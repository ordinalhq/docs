The calendar is your command center for scheduled content. Toggle between a visual calendar grid and a sortable list view, filter by platform or status, and drag posts to reschedule. Whether you're planning weeks ahead or reviewing today's queue, the calendar keeps everything in one place.

## Views

Toggle between **Calendar** and **List** using the icons in the top-left corner:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Calendar">
    The default visual grid showing posts by date:

    - Posts appear as cards on their scheduled day
    - Platform icons show which channels each post targets
    - Color-coded by status (gray = draft, yellow = scheduled, green = posted, red = failed)
    - Drag posts to reschedule them
    - Click any day to create a new post for that date
    - US holidays are labeled on their respective days

    **Time frames**: Choose how much time to display—1 Week (`W`), 2 Weeks (`X`), or 1 Month (`M`). The 2-week view is the default.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="List">
    A sortable table format for managing many posts at once:

    - Columns: Date, Post Name, Status, Channels, Labels, Campaign
    - Click column headers to sort
    - Filter by date range using the date column
    - Bulk select posts for actions
    - Better for reviewing large volumes of scheduled content
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating Posts

Click anywhere on the calendar to create a post for that date. The new post modal opens with the date pre-filled—just add your content and save.

<Tip>
  Creating from the calendar is often faster than creating a post and then scheduling it—you go straight to the time you want.
</Tip>

## Rescheduling

Drag posts directly to new dates:

- In calendar view, drag posts between days
- Cross-platform posts (posts scheduled to multiple channels) move together
- A confirmation toast appears when you successfully reschedule

You can also click a post to open it, then change the scheduled date and time in the post editor.

<Note>
  Published posts cannot be rescheduled—they've already gone live.
</Note>

## Filtering

Focus on specific content using the filter dropdown:

| Filter | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| **Channel** | Show only LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. |
| **Status** | Show only scheduled, posted, or failed |
| **Label** | Focus on specific content categories |
| **Campaign** | See only posts in a campaign |
| **Account** | Show posts for specific profiles |

Filters combine to narrow your view. Clear all filters to see everything.

### Saved Views

Save frequently-used filter combinations as named views that appear in your sidebar for quick access:

1. Apply your filters (channel, status, label, etc.)
2. Click **Save** in the filter bar
3. Name your view (e.g., "LinkedIn Only" or "Scheduled This Week")

Saved views appear in the sidebar under **All Posts**, so you can jump to filtered views with one click. Right-click any saved view to rename or delete it.

## Campaigns on Calendar

Campaigns help you organize larger launches, multi-day events, or themed content series. On the calendar, campaigns appear as colored bars spanning their date range—making it easy to see when campaigns start and end at a glance.

- Each campaign shows as a distinct colored band across its dates
- Click a campaign bar to open the campaign details

**Show/Hide Campaigns**: Use the eye icon in the calendar header to toggle campaign visibility. This is helpful when you want to focus on individual posts without the campaign overlay.

## Settings

### Timezone

The calendar displays in your workspace timezone, set in [**Settings → General**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/general). All team members see the same times regardless of their local timezone—this prevents scheduling confusion across distributed teams.

### Start of Week

Choose whether your calendar week starts on Sunday or Monday. Set this in your user preferences under [**Settings → Account**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/account).
