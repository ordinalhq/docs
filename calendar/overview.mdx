## Tips for effective scheduling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review month view regularly">
    Spot gaps in your publishing cadence before they become problems. Aim for consistent presence throughout the month.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use filters purposefully">
    Check each platform's schedule independently. You might be over-posting on LinkedIn while neglecting Twitter.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor failed posts">
    Red indicators need immediate attention. Don't let failed posts sit—they may be time-sensitive.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan ahead">
    Schedule content 1-2 weeks out minimum. This gives you buffer for review, approval, and unexpected changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check before weekends">
    Verify nothing important is scheduled when team coverage is light. Consider approval and response readiness.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Posts not appearing">
    Check your current filters. Posts may be filtered out by platform, status, or label. Clear all filters to see everything.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't drag posts">
    Ensure you're clicking directly on the post card. Published posts cannot be rescheduled.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong timezone showing">
    Verify workspace timezone in **Settings → General**. The calendar always uses workspace timezone, not your browser's local time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
