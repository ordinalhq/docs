Use webhooks to get real-time notifications on events happening across your Ordinal workspace. With Ordinal webhooks, you can build custom integrations, such as:

- Syncing post data to your CRM when content goes live
- Building internal dashboards that track publishing activity across your team

In this guide, we'll show you how to configure webhooks and document the available events you can listen to.

## Creating a webhook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Webhooks Settings">
    Navigate to [**Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/integrations/webhooks).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events">
    Click **Create a Webhook** and choose which events to subscribe to. Each webhook can listen to one or more event types.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Your Webhook">
    Enter a name, your endpoint URL, and optionally a description. You can add custom headers (e.g. for authentication) if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Payload format

All webhook deliveries use the same envelope. The request body is JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "post.published",
  "data": { ... },
  "createdAt": "2025-02-26T14:30:00.000Z"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `type` | The event type (e.g. `post.published`, `post.archived`) |
| `data` | Event-specific payload. See each event page for the schema. |
| `createdAt` | ISO 8601 timestamp when the event was emitted |

Your endpoint should respond with a `2xx` status code to acknowledge receipt.

See [Event types](/integrations/webhooks/event-types) for the full list of supported events and links to each payload schema.
