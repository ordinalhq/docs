Ordinal sends webhook notifications when events occur in your workspace. Every payload uses this structure:

```json
{
  "type": "post.published",
  "data": {},
  "createdAt": "2025-02-26T14:30:00.000Z"
}
```

- **type** – Event type (e.g. `post.published`)
- **data** – Event-specific payload; see each event page for the schema
- **createdAt** – ISO 8601 timestamp when the event was emitted

| [`social_profile.disconnected`](/integrations/webhooks/social-profile-disconnected) | A profile is disconnected from the workspace |
| [`social_profile.reconnect_needed`](/integrations/webhooks/social-profile-reconnect-needed) | A profile needs reconnecting (e.g. token expired) |
