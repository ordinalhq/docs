## Overview

Inline comments are text-anchored comments attached to specific content within a post. Unlike regular post comments, inline comments highlight specific text and are organized by channel (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.).

The API provides read-only access to inline comments. Creating and resolving inline comments is done through the Ordinal web interface.

| GET | `/posts/{postId}/inline-comments` | [List inline comments on a post](/api-reference/inline-comments/inline-comments-list) |

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/posts/POST_ID/inline-comments" \

## Understanding Inline Comments

### Highlighted Text

The `highlightedText` field contains the exact text that was selected when the comment was created. This helps provide context even if the post content has since changed.

<Note>
If the highlighted text has been deleted or significantly modified, the `highlightedText` field may be empty or may not match the current post content.
</Note>

### Resolution Status

Inline comments can be marked as resolved when feedback has been addressed:
- `resolved: false` - Comment still needs attention
- `resolved: true` - Comment has been addressed

Use the `resolved` query parameter to filter comments by status.

### Threaded Replies

Each inline comment contains an array of `replies`. The first reply is the original comment, and subsequent replies form a threaded conversation. Comments with no non-deleted replies are not included in the response.

## Error Responses

| Status | Code | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Post not found or doesn't belong to the workspace |

```json
{
  "code": "NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Post not found or does not belong to this workspace"
}
```

## Important Notes

<Note>
The inline comments API is read-only. To create, reply to, or resolve inline comments, use the Ordinal web interface.
</Note>

<Note>
Inline comments are stored per-channel. A post with LinkedIn and Twitter content will have separate inline comments for each channel.
