## Overview

The Ordinal API allows you to programmatically create and manage posts, profiles, approvals, labels, and analytics data within your workspace. The API follows REST conventions and uses JSON for request and response bodies.

## Quick Start

<Info>
  **Pro Plan Required**
  
  The Ordinal API is available on the Pro plan or higher. [Upgrade your workspace](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/pricing) to access API features.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an API Key">
    Navigate to your workspace settings and create a new API key. See the [Authentication](/api/authentication) guide for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Your First Request">
    Use the API key as a Bearer token to authenticate your requests:

    We recommend testing the [Get Workspace](/api-reference/workspaces/get-workspace) endpoint to confirm that your API key is working.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/workspace" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
    ```

    Confirm that you see your workspace information in the response.

    ```json
    {
      "id": "your-workspace-uuid",
      "name": "Your Workspace",
      "slug": "your-workspace",
      "timezone": "America/New_York",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Endpoints">
    Browse the endpoint documentation to discover all available operations for posts, profiles, approvals, and more.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage of 100 requests per minute per API key. When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with information about when your quota resets.

```json
{
  "code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "message": "Rate limit of 100 requests per 60s exceeded. Quota resets in 45 seconds"
}
```

If you need a higher rate limit, please reach out to support.
