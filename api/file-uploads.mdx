description: 'How to upload files from URLs for use in posts'
---

## Overview

The Ordinal API uses a URL-based upload system. Instead of uploading files directly, you provide a publicly accessible URL and Ordinal downloads and processes the file for you. This approach simplifies integration and avoids the complexity of multipart form uploads.

Uploads are processed asynchronously. When you submit a URL, you receive an upload job ID that you can poll until the file is ready. Once ready, you'll receive an `assetId` to use when creating posts.

## Supported File Types

| Type | Formats |
|------|---------|
| Images | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP |
| Videos | MP4, QuickTime (MOV) |

## File Size Limits

| Type | Max Size |
|------|----------|
| Images | 10 MB |
| GIFs | 15 MB |
| Videos | 350 MB |

<Note>
Images cannot exceed 36 megapixels total resolution.
</Note>

## Upload Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit the File URL">
    [POST to `/uploads`](/api-reference/file-uploads/uploads-create) with the publicly accessible URL of the file you want to upload.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Upload Job ID">
    The API returns an upload job ID with `pending` status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Poll for Status">
    [Poll GET `/uploads/{id}`](/api-reference/file-uploads/uploads-get) until the status changes to `ready`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the Asset ID">
    Once ready, use the returned `assetId` in the `assetIds` array when [creating posts](/api-reference/posts/posts-create).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Upload Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Upload is queued and waiting to be processed |
| `processing` | File is being downloaded and processed |
| `ready` | Upload is complete. Use the `assetId` to attach to posts |
| `failed` | Upload failed. Check the `error` field for details |
| `expired` | Upload expired before being used in a post |

## Creating an Upload

Submit a file URL to create an upload job:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/uploads" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/images/product-photo.jpg"}'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "d4f8e2a1-3b7c-4e9d-8f2a-1c5b9e7d3a6f",
  "status": "pending",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-04T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Checking Upload Status

Poll the upload endpoint to check when processing is complete:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/uploads/d4f8e2a1-3b7c-4e9d-8f2a-1c5b9e7d3a6f" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Ready Response

When the upload is ready, the response includes the `assetId` and file metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "d4f8e2a1-3b7c-4e9d-8f2a-1c5b9e7d3a6f",
  "status": "ready",
  "assetId": "a7c2e4b9-5d1f-4a8e-9c3b-2f6d8e1a4b7c",
  "filename": "product-photo.jpg",
  "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
  "size": 245678,
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "duration": null,
  "expiresAt": "2026-02-11T10:30:00.000Z",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-04T10:30:00.000Z",
  "readyAt": "2026-02-04T10:30:15.000Z"
}
```

### Failed Response

If the upload fails, the response includes an error message:

```json
{
  "id": "d4f8e2a1-3b7c-4e9d-8f2a-1c5b9e7d3a6f",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Failed to download file: HTTP 404",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-04T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Using Assets in Posts

Include the `assetId` in the `assetIds` array when creating a post:

```json
{
  "title": "Product Launch",
  "publishAt": "2026-02-10T14:00:00.000Z",
  "status": "Scheduled",
  "linkedIn": {
    "profileId": "b3e7f1c9-2d4a-4f8b-a6c1-9e5d7b2f8a3c",
    "copy": "Check out our new product!",
    "assetIds": ["a7c2e4b9-5d1f-4a8e-9c3b-2f6d8e1a4b7c"]
  }
}
```

### Platform Attachment Limits

| Platform | Max Attachments |
|----------|-----------------|
| X (Twitter) | 4 |
| LinkedIn | 20 |

## Important Notes

<Warning>
The file URL must be publicly accessible. Ordinal's servers need to download the file, so URLs that require authentication or are behind firewalls will fail.
</Warning>

<Note>
Uploads expire within 24 hours if not used in a post. Once an upload expires, you'll need to create a new upload job with the file URL.
</Note>

<Note>
For videos, the `duration` field in the ready response contains the video length in seconds. For images, this field is `null`.
</Note>
