description: "Secure your API requests with Bearer token authentication"

## Overview

The Ordinal API uses Bearer token authentication. All API requests must include a valid API key in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer ord_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

<Info>
  **Workspace-Level Authentication**

  API keys are scoped to a specific workspace and provide access to all resources within that workspace. If you're an agency managing multiple client workspaces, you'll need to create a separate API key for each workspace.
</Info>

## Generating an API Key

<Info>
  **Pro Plan Required**

  The Ordinal API is available on the Pro plan or higher. [Upgrade your workspace](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/pricing) to access API features.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workspace Settings">
    Go to the [API Keys page](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/integrations/api) in your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open API Keys Section">
    Click on the "API Keys" tab in the settings menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Click "Create an API Key" and provide a descriptive name for the key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your Key">
    Copy the generated API key immediately. For security reasons, the full key is only shown once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Store your API key securely. Never expose it in client-side code, public repositories, or share it with unauthorized users.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/workspace" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ord_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```


```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/workspace', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ord_live_abc123...'
  }
});
```


```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/workspace',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer ord_live_abc123...'}
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it in your application.

    ```bash
    export ORDINAL_API_KEY="ord_live_abc123..."
    ```

    ```javascript
    const apiKey = process.env.ORDINAL_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    Periodically rotate your API keys to minimize the impact of potential key exposure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Key Usage">
    Regularly review your API key usage in the dashboard to detect any unusual activity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Revoke Compromised Keys">
    If you suspect an API key has been compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing API Keys

### Viewing Keys

You can view all your API keys in the workspace settings. Each key shows:

- Name and description
- Creation date
- Last used timestamp

### Revoking Keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Navigate to workspace settings
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click the `...` button and select "Revoke"
4. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Revoking an API key is permanent and cannot be undone. Any applications using the revoked key will immediately lose access.
