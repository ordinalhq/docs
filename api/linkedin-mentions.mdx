## Overview

LinkedIn uses a special mention format to tag people and companies in posts and comments. Unlike platforms like Twitter where you can simply use `@username`, LinkedIn requires a specific format that includes the account's URN (Uniform Resource Name).

## Mention Format

To mention someone on LinkedIn, use this format in your `copy` field:

```
@[Display Name](urn)
```

For example:
- **Person**: `@[John Doe](urn:li:person:ABC123xyz)`
- **Company**: `@[Acme Inc](urn:li:organization:123456)`

When the post is published, LinkedIn will convert these into clickable profile links and notify the tagged accounts.

## Finding URNs

Use the [Mention format by username](/api-reference/linkedin/linkedin-get-mention) endpoint to look up URNs by LinkedIn username.

The username is the part after `/in/` or `/company/` in a LinkedIn profile URL:
- `linkedin.com/in/johndoe` → `johndoe`
- `linkedin.com/company/acme-inc` → `acme-inc`

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/linkedin/johndoe/mentions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "user": {
    "username": "johndoe",
    "urn": "urn:li:person:ABC123xyz",
    "type": "User",
    "displayName": "John Doe",
    "firstName": "John",
    "mentionFormat": "@[John Doe](urn:li:person:ABC123xyz)",
    "firstNameMentionFormat": "@[John](urn:li:person:ABC123xyz)"
  },
  "organization": null
}
```

The response includes pre-formatted `mentionFormat` strings that you can copy directly into your post content.

## Using Mentions in Posts

Include the mention format directly in your post `copy`:

```json
{
  "title": "Product Launch",
  "publishAt": "2026-01-20T14:00:00.000Z",
  "status": "Scheduled",
  "linkedIn": {
    "profileId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "copy": "Excited to announce our partnership with @[Acme Inc](urn:li:organization:123456)!\n\nHuge thanks to @[John Doe](urn:li:person:ABC123xyz) for making this happen."
  }
}
```

## Using Mentions in Engagements

Mentions also work in auto-engagement comments and reposts:

```json
{
  "channel": "LinkedIn",
  "engagements": [
    {
      "type": "Comment",
      "profileId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002",
      "copy": "Great insights @[Jane Smith](urn:li:person:XYZ789abc)! What do you think about this?",
      "delaySeconds": 300
    }
  ]
}
```

## First Name vs Full Name

For personal profiles, you can choose to display just the first name:

| Format | Result on LinkedIn |
|--------|-------------------|
| `@[John Doe](urn:li:person:ABC123)` | **John Doe** |
| `@[John](urn:li:person:ABC123)` | **John** |

The mention lookup endpoint provides both `mentionFormat` (full name) and `firstNameMentionFormat` (first name only) for convenience.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
The display name in the mention must be a prefix of the account's actual name. For example, if the account name is "John Doe", you can use `@[John Doe]` or `@[John]`, but not `@[Johnny]` or `@[J. Doe]`.
</Warning>

<Note>
Mentions are only supported on LinkedIn. For X (Twitter), use the standard `@username` format directly in your post copy.
