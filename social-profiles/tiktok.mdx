TikTok offers some of the best organic reach of any platform—if you have the video content to match. In Ordinal, you can schedule videos with captions and hashtags, configure privacy and interaction settings, and publish directly to your account.

## Overview

TikTok requires a **Business or Creator account**—personal accounts don't have API access. Your profile must also be public. To switch account types: **TikTok Settings → Manage Account → Switch to Business Account**.

## Connecting TikTok

Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/scheduling/tiktok), select TikTok, and sign in. Authorize Ordinal and your account will appear in your connected profiles.

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Account type       | Business or Creator                     |
| Profile visibility | Public (private profiles can't connect) |

## Drafting a TikTok Post

### What you can post

| Content                       | Supported | Notes                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| [Videos](#video-requirements) | ✅         | Single video per post |
| Images                        | ❌         | TikTok is video-only  |
| Trending sounds               | ❌         | API limitation        |
| Filters/effects               | ❌         | API limitation        |
| Duets/Stitches                | ❌         | API limitation        |
| Text overlays                 | ❌         | API limitation        |

### Caption & Formatting

Write captions to accompany your video:

- **Bold / Italic**: Use the toolbar buttons for Unicode formatting
- **Hashtags**: Type `#` followed by your tag—they'll link to TikTok's tag page when published
- **@Mentions**: Type `@` followed by a username to tag other creators

Captions can be up to **2,200 characters**.

<Tip>
  Mix trending hashtags with niche-specific ones. 3–5 per post is a good balance for discoverability without looking spammy.
</Tip>

### Post Preview

As you draft your post, the editor shows a live preview that matches how your video will appear in the TikTok feed—complete with your profile picture, username, and caption overlay.

### Video Requirements

TikTok only accepts video—no images. Here are the specs:

| Spec         | Limit                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Formats      | MP4, MOV                           |
| Resolution   | 360px to 4096px (width and height) |
| Aspect ratio | 9:16 (vertical) recommended        |
| Duration     | 3 seconds to 10 minutes            |
| File size    | 500MB maximum                      |

Vertical video (9:16) performs best and fills the entire screen. Horizontal or square videos work but won't have the same impact. Files over 125MB are automatically compressed before upload.

## Post Settings

Configure how viewers can interact with your video. You'll find these options below the caption editor:

- **Privacy**: Choose who can see your video—Public, Followers, Friends, or just yourself
- **Comments**: Enable or disable comments on your video
- **Duets**: Allow others to create Duets with your video
- **Stitch**: Allow others to Stitch your video into their content
- **Sponsored**: Mark the video as promotional content
- **Paid Partnership**: Disclose paid brand partnerships (only appears if Sponsored is enabled)

<Tip>
  Enabling Duets and Stitches can increase your reach—other creators using your content exposes you to their audience.
</Tip>

## Analytics

View video performance in [**Analytics → TikTok**](https://app.tryordinal.com/analytics/tiktok). You'll see views, likes, comments, and shares for each video.

<Note>
  TikTok provides less API data than most platforms. For detailed analytics like watch time and audience demographics, check TikTok directly.
