TikTok is video-only. In Ordinal, you can schedule videos with captions and hashtags, choosing between direct publishing or sending to your TikTok inbox for final touches.

## Overview

TikTok requires a **Business or Creator account**—personal accounts don't have API access. Your profile must also be public.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Account type | Business or Creator |
| Profile visibility | Public |
| Content | Video only (no images) |

To switch account types: **TikTok Settings → Manage Account → Switch to Business Account**.

## Connecting TikTok

Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select TikTok, sign in, and authorize Ordinal.

TikTok tokens can expire unpredictably. You'll see a warning when it's time to reconnect.

## Direct Post vs. Send to Inbox

TikTok offers two publishing methods:

| Method | How it works | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Direct Post** | Video publishes directly at scheduled time | Most posts—no extra steps needed |
| **Send to Inbox** | Video goes to your TikTok inbox; you finalize manually | When you want to add sounds, effects, or text overlays |

Direct Post is the default when available. Use Send to Inbox if you need TikTok-native features that aren't available via API.

## What you can post

| Content | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Videos | ✅ |
| Images | ❌ |
| Trending sounds | ❌ (API limitation) |
| Filters/effects | ❌ (API limitation) |
| Duets/Stitches | ❌ (API limitation) |
| Text overlays | ❌ (API limitation) |

If you need sounds, effects, or interactive features, use Send to Inbox and add them in the TikTok app before publishing.

## Video specifications

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Formats | MP4, WebM |
| Aspect ratio | 9:16 (vertical) recommended |
| Resolution | 720p minimum, 1080p recommended |
| Length | 3 seconds to 10 minutes |
| File size | 500 MB maximum |

Vertical video (9:16) performs best. Horizontal or square videos work but won't fill the screen.

## Captions

Captions support up to 2,200 characters. Include hashtags for discoverability and @mention other users.

<Tip>
Mix trending hashtags with niche-specific ones. 3–5 per post is a good balance.

## Analytics

Basic analytics are available—video views and engagement. TikTok provides less API data than most platforms, so detailed analytics require checking TikTok directly.

## Common issues

**Can't connect**: Verify your account is public and set to Business or Creator. Try an incognito browser window.

**Video won't upload**: Check format (MP4/WebM), size (under 500 MB), length (under 10 min), and resolution (at least 720p).

**Video in inbox but not posted**: Open TikTok, find the video in your inbox, and complete the post manually.

## Tips

- **Hook viewers in the first 3 seconds**—watch time is everything on TikTok
- **Post consistently**—the algorithm rewards regular uploads
- **Engage with comments**—it boosts visibility
- **Vertical video only**—9:16 for full-screen experience
