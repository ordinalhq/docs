LinkedIn is one of the most-used platforms in Ordinal. You can connect personal profiles to build your individual brand, or company pages to publish as your organization. Most users connect both.

## Overview

With Ordinal, you can connect and schedule to both LinkedIn **Personal Profiles** and **Company Pages**. The connection process for both is the same.

You can also connect LinkedIn for **engagement** (liking, commenting, and reposting) separately from scheduling. This is useful if you want to interact from Ordinal without publishing, or if you've hit your scheduling profile limit.

## Connecting LinkedIn

**For scheduling**: Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select LinkedIn, and sign in. If you're a page admin, you'll see your company pages listed after authorization.

**For engagement**: Go to **Settings → Profiles → Engagement** and connect separately.

<Tip>
  Company pages require Super Admin or Content Admin access to connect.

## Permissions

When you connect, Ordinal requests permission to share posts, view your profile, access company pages you admin, and read analytics. We never access your messages, connect with people, or modify your profile settings.

## Analytics

View post performance in **Analytics → LinkedIn**. You'll see impressions, engagement breakdown (likes, comments, shares), click-through rate, and follower growth for company pages.

## Common issues

**Company page not appearing**: You need Admin access, not just employee access. Check your page roles in LinkedIn.

**Connection expired**: LinkedIn tokens expire roughly every 60 days. You'll see a warning—click Reconnect to re-authorize.

**Post failed**: Usually caused by an expired token, content that's too long, or media that doesn't meet specs. Check the error message for specifics.

## Tips

- **Post during business hours**—engagement peaks Tuesday–Thursday, 8–10 AM and around noon
- **Personal profiles often get more reach than company pages**—use both strategically
