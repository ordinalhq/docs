LinkedIn is one of the most-used platforms in Ordinal. You can connect personal profiles (your own profile, execs, employees, etc.), or company pages to publish as your organization.

## Overview

With Ordinal, you can connect and schedule to both LinkedIn **Personal Profiles** and **Company Pages**. The connection process for both is the same.

## Connecting LinkedIn

There are two types of connections supported for LinkedIn: **scheduling** and **engagement-only**. Scheduling profiles can schedule posts, use auto-engagements, and view analytics. Engagement-only profiles can only be used for auto-engagements. You can customize which permissions to grant for your profile (like, comment, and/or reposts)

**For scheduling**: Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/scheduling/linkedin), click on "Connect LinkedIn", and sign in via LinkedIn.

**For engagement-only**: Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Engagement**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/engagement/linkedin), click on "Connect LinkedIn", and sign in via LinkedIn.

<Tip>
  If you're a company admin, you'll see your company pages listed after authorization and you can choose which page to connect.

| [Reposts](#reposts)               | ✅         | Repost any other LinkedIn post with just the Post URL |

### Drafting & Formatting

The LinkedIn editor supports rich formatting:

- **Bold / Italic**: Highlight the text you want to format and use the toolbar buttons or press `Cmd/Ctrl + B` for bold and `Cmd/Ctrl + I` for italic
- **Hashtags**: Type `#` followed by your tag - they'll automatically link when published
- **Links**: Paste URLs directly into your post (and use a [link shortener](/analytics/shortlinks) for detailed click analytics)

LinkedIn posts can be up to **3,000 characters**. The character counter in the editor updates in real-time as you type.

### Post Preview

![Linkedin Feed Preview](/images/linkedinfeedpreview.jpg)

As you draft your post, the editor shows a live preview that matches how your content will appear on LinkedIn - including proper text truncation with "see more" exactly where LinkedIn would cut off.

For a more realistic preview, click the **Feed Preview** button to see your post in a full LinkedIn feed context with:

- Your profile picture and name as they'll appear
- Desktop and mobile view options
- Real-time updates as you continue editing

### Tagging

![Linkedin Tagging](/images/linkedintagging.jpg)

Tag people and companies in your LinkedIn posts to increase engagement and notify them:

1. Type `@` in your post
2. Paste in the LinkedIn username from the URL of the profile you want to tag (e.g. `www.linkedin.com/in/[username]` or `www.linkedin.com/company/[company-name]`)
3. Select from the suggestions dropdown

Ordinal searches LinkedIn by username and displays exact search matches and partial matches to accounts you've tagged before for quick access. For personal accounts, you can choose to display just the first name or the full name in the published post by simply deleting the last name.

<Tip>
  Mentions become clickable links when published and may notify the tagged account, encouraging them to engage with your post.
</Tip>

### Links

When you add a URL to your post, Ordinal automatically fetches the link preview - showing you the title and thumbnail image before publishing.

**Customizing link previews:**

- Click the preview card to open the **Edit Link Preview** modal
- Change the title text that appears in the preview
- Upload a custom thumbnail image to replace the default
- Delete the preview entirely if you prefer a text-only post

Link previews help your content stand out in the feed and give readers context before they click.

## Auto-Engagements

![Linkedin Auto Eng](/images/linkedinauto-eng.jpg)

<Note>
  Note: Auto-engagements are available for Pro plan workspaces and above. Starter workspaces can only add auto-engagements from the same account as the post author.
</Note>

Automatically interact with your own posts after they publish to boost initial visibility. LinkedIn supports three auto-engagement types:

| Type             | What it does                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-Like**    | Connected profiles like your post within the first 10 minutes                                 |
| **Auto-Comment** | Add a first comment (great for CTAs, additional links, or hashtags) on a custom time delay    |
| **Auto-Repost**  | Reshare (repost with thoughts) from another connected LinkedIn account on a custom time delay |

Configure timing from **immediately** after posting up to **24 hours** later. Staggering engagements with different delays helps them appear more natural.
