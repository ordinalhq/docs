LinkedIn is one of the most-used platforms in Ordinal. You can connect personal profiles to build your individual brand, or company pages to publish as your organization. Most users connect both.

## Overview

LinkedIn supports two account types with different capabilities:

| Type | Best for | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Personal profile** | Thought leadership, personal brand, networking | Posts appear from you |
| **Company page** | Brand content, company updates, job posts | Posts appear from the organization |

You can also connect LinkedIn for **engagement** (liking and commenting) separately from scheduling. This is useful if you want to interact from Ordinal without publishing, or if you've hit your scheduling profile limit.

<Tip>
Company pages require Admin access to connect. Your personal account authenticates the connection, but posts appear as the company.
</Tip>

## Connecting LinkedIn

**For scheduling**: Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select LinkedIn, and sign in. If you're a page admin, you'll see your company pages listed after authorization.

**For engagement**: Go to **Settings → Profiles → Engagement** and connect separately. Engagement profiles don't count toward your plan limit.

## What you can post

| Content | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Text posts | ✅ | |
| Images | ✅ | Single or carousel (up to 9) |
| Video | ✅ | Up to 10 minutes |
| PDF documents | ✅ | Creates swipeable carousel, great for decks |
| External links | ✅ | With preview |
| Polls | ❌ | LinkedIn API doesn't support polls |

### Document posts

PDF uploads create document carousels—swipeable slides that consistently perform well on LinkedIn. Use them for frameworks, guides, tutorials, or repurposing slide decks. Limit: 300 pages, 100 MB.

## Features

**@Mentions**: Tag people and companies by typing `@` and selecting from suggestions. Works in both personal and company posts.

**Hashtags**: LinkedIn uses hashtags for distribution. 3–5 relevant hashtags is the sweet spot—more can look spammy.

**Link previews**: When you include a URL, you'll see the preview before posting. You can choose to show or hide the preview image.

## Media specifications

| Type | Formats | Size limit |
|------|---------|------------|
| Images | JPG, PNG, GIF | 8 MB each, up to 9 |
| Videos | MP4, MOV | 200 MB, up to 10 min |
| PDFs | PDF | 100 MB, up to 300 pages |

## Permissions

When you connect, Ordinal requests permission to share posts, view your profile, access company pages you admin, and read analytics. We never access your messages, connect with people, or modify your profile settings.

## Analytics

View post performance in **Analytics → LinkedIn**. You'll see impressions, engagement breakdown (likes, comments, shares), click-through rate, and follower growth for company pages.

## Common issues

**Company page not appearing**: You need Admin access, not just employee access. Check your page roles in LinkedIn.

**Connection expired**: LinkedIn tokens expire roughly every 60 days. You'll see a warning—click Reconnect to re-authorize.

**Post failed**: Usually caused by an expired token, content that's too long, or media that doesn't meet specs. Check the error message for specifics.

## Tips

- **Post during business hours**—engagement peaks Tuesday–Thursday, 8–10 AM and around noon
- **Document posts outperform most other formats**—consider converting your best content into PDFs
- **Personal profiles often get more reach than company pages**—use both strategically
