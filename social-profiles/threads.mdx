Threads is Meta's text-based platform, designed for public conversations. It connects through your Instagram account and works well for cross-posting alongside Twitter.

## Overview

Threads is tied to Instagram—you need an Instagram Business or Creator account to connect, and your Threads profile must be public. The authentication flows through Meta, so if you've already connected Instagram, Threads setup is faster.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Account type | Instagram Business or Creator |
| Profile visibility | Public (private profiles can't connect) |
| Authentication | Via Instagram/Meta |

## Connecting Threads

Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select Threads, and sign in with your Instagram credentials. If your Instagram is already connected, you may only need to authorize the additional Threads permissions.

Tokens expire roughly every 60 days (same as Instagram).

## What you can post

| Content | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Text posts | ✅ |
| Images | ✅ |
| Carousels | ✅ |
| Video | ✅ |
| Audio | ✅ |
| Multi-part threads | ✅ |
| Polls | ❌ |

### Multi-part threads

For longer content, create multi-part posts where each segment connects to the previous one. Each segment has its own 500-character limit and can include its own media.

To create a thread: write your first segment, click **Add Thread**, and continue adding. All segments publish together as a connected conversation.

## Character limits

| Element | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Per post/segment | 500 characters |
| Links | Count toward the 500 limit |

## Media specifications

| Type | Formats | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Images | JPG, PNG | Up to 10 per carousel, 1080×1080 or 1080×1350 recommended |
| Videos | MP4 | Up to 5 minutes, vertical (9:16) recommended |

## Cross-posting with Twitter

Threads and Twitter are both text-focused, so they're natural cross-post candidates. When creating a post, select both platforms and customize for each if needed.

<Tip>
Even when cross-posting, consider tailoring slightly for each audience. What works on Twitter doesn't always land the same way on Threads.

## Analytics

View performance in **Analytics → Threads**: reach, engagement (likes, replies, reposts), and follower growth.

## Common issues

**Can't find Threads option**: Connect Instagram first. Threads requires an active Instagram connection.

**Can't connect**: Verify your Threads profile is public and your Instagram is a Business or Creator account.

**Content too long**: Each segment is limited to 500 characters. Split longer content into multiple segments.

## Tips

- **Be conversational**—Threads rewards authenticity over polish
- **Engage with replies**—the platform is built around conversation
- **Use multi-part threads** for anything that doesn't fit in 500 characters
