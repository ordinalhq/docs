Threads is where text-first conversations happen. If you're already on Instagram, you likely have a Threads account—and in Ordinal, you can schedule text posts, image carousels, videos, and multi-part threads to keep the conversation going.

## Overview

Threads connects through Instagram and requires a **Business or Creator account** (not personal). Your Threads profile must also be public—private profiles can't connect via the API.

## Connecting Threads

Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/scheduling/threads), click **Connect Account**, and select Threads. You'll sign in with your Instagram credentials.

| Requirement        | Details                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Account type       | Instagram Business or Creator           |
| Profile visibility | Public (private profiles can't connect) |
| Authentication     | Via Instagram/Meta                      |

<Tip>
  If you've already connected Instagram, Threads setup is faster—you may only need to authorize the additional Threads permissions.

## Drafting a Threads Post

### What you can post

| Feature                                   | Supported | Notes                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| Text posts                                | ✅         | Up to 500 characters        |
| [Images](#images)                         | ✅         | Up to 20 per carousel       |
| [Videos](#videos)                         | ✅         | Up to 5 minutes             |
| [Multi-part threads](#multi-part-threads) | ✅         | Each segment gets own media |
| Polls                                     | ❌         | Not currently supported     |

### Drafting & Formatting

The Threads editor supports rich formatting through Unicode characters, which render as **bold** and _italic_ on Threads:

- **Bold / Italic**: Use the toolbar buttons or press `Cmd/Ctrl + B` for bold and `Cmd/Ctrl + I` for italic
- **Hashtags**: Type `#` followed by your tag—they'll automatically link to Threads search
- **Mentions**: Type `@` followed by a username—they'll link to that profile on Threads
- **Links**: Paste URLs directly into your post (they count toward the 500 character limit)

Each post or thread segment is limited to **500 characters**. The character counter updates in real-time as you type.

### Post Preview

As you draft, the editor shows a live preview that matches how your content will appear on Threads—including your profile picture and username.

### Link Previews

When you add a URL to a text-only post (no images or videos), Ordinal displays a link preview card showing the destination's title and thumbnail. Link previews only appear when your post has no media attached—adding images or videos takes priority.

## Post Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Images">
    Upload images to create visual posts or carousels:

    | Spec         | Limit                               |
    | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
    | Formats      | JPG, PNG                            |
    | Size         | 8MB per image                       |
    | Aspect ratio | Max 10:1 (images too wide rejected) |
    | Per post     | Up to 20 images                     |

    Multiple images automatically create a swipeable carousel. Ordinal compresses oversized images automatically.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Videos">
    Upload video content directly to Threads:

    | Spec         | Limit           |
    | ------------ | --------------- |
    | Formats      | MP4, MOV        |
    | Duration     | Up to 5 minutes |
    | Aspect ratio | 0.01:1 to 10:1  |

    Vertical video (9:16) is recommended for best display on mobile. Ordinal automatically compresses videos over 125MB or wider than 1920px.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multi-part Threads

Multi-part threads let you tell longer stories across multiple connected posts. Each segment can have its own text and media.

**Creating a multi-part thread:**

1. Write your first post
2. Click **Add Thread** to add the next segment
3. Each segment gets its own 500-character limit and media
4. Continue adding as many segments as needed
5. All segments publish together in sequence

### Reordering Segments

Use the **up/down arrow buttons** next to each segment to rearrange the order. Changes save automatically.

<Tip>
  The first segment is what people see in their feed—make it compelling to encourage them to read on.
