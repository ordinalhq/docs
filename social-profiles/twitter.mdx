Twitter is one of the fastest platforms for real-time engagement. In Ordinal, you can schedule individual tweets, build multi-tweet threads, and coordinate auto-engagements—all timed to publish when your audience is most active.

## Overview

With Ordinal, you can connect Twitter accounts for both **scheduling** and **engagement**. Most users connect both to get the full experience.

## Connecting Twitter

There are two types of connections supported for Twitter: **scheduling** and **engagement-only**. Scheduling profiles can post tweets, threads, and use auto-engagements. Engagement-only profiles are used purely for auto-engagements (liking, retweeting, replying to posts).

**For scheduling**: Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/scheduling/x), select Twitter/X, and sign in.

**For engagement-only**: Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Engagement**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/engagement/x) and connect separately.

### Drafting & Formatting

The Twitter editor supports Unicode formatting for **bold** and _italic_ text:

- **Bold / Italic**: Use the toolbar buttons or press `Cmd/Ctrl + B` for bold and `Cmd/Ctrl + I` for italic
- **Hashtags**: Type `#` followed by your tag—they'll automatically link when published
- **Mentions**: Type `@` followed by a username to mention someone
- **Links**: Paste URLs directly into your tweet (and use a [link shortener](/analytics/shortlinks) for detailed click analytics)

### Long-form Tweets

![X Premium](/images/x-premium.jpg)

Twitter Premium subscribers can post tweets up to **4,000 characters**—far beyond the standard 280 limit. Ordinal automatically detects your account type and adjusts the character counter accordingly.

Long-form tweets display with a "**Show more**" link in the feed. Note that Twitter does not show link preview images on long-form tweets.

### Post Preview

![X Feed Preview](/images/x-feed-preview.jpg)

As you draft your tweet, the editor shows a live preview that matches how your content will appear on Twitter—including proper text truncation with "See more" for longer posts.

For a more realistic preview, click the **Feed Preview** button to see your tweet in a full Twitter feed context with desktop and mobile previews.

### Photo Options

**Alt text**: Add descriptions to your images for accessibility. Click the image options menu and enter alt text (up to 1,000 characters) that describes the visual content for screen readers.

**Photo tagging**: Tag users in your images to notify them and increase visibility:

1. Add images to your tweet
2. Click the **Tag Users** button (user icon)
3. Enter Twitter handles (without the @)
4. Add up to 10 users per tweet

<Note>
  Photo tagging only works for public accounts. If a tagged user has disabled photo-tagging, the tweet will post without their tag.
</Note>

### Post Types

## Tweet Threads

Threads are Twitter's way of telling longer stories across multiple connected tweets. Each tweet in a thread can have its own media.

### **Creating a thread:**

1. Write your first tweet
2. Click **Add Tweet** to add the next tweet
3. Continue adding tweets to your thread
4. Preview the entire thread before scheduling
5. All tweets publish in sequence automatically

### Splitting Tweets

You can quickly split a tweet into two using your keyboard:

- **Press Enter 3 times** at the end of a tweet to add a new empty tweet after it
- **Press Enter 5 times** in the middle of text to split the tweet at that point—content after the split moves to a new tweet

This makes it easy to break up long drafts into thread-sized chunks without copy-pasting.

### Reordering Tweets

Rearrange tweets in your thread using the arrow buttons:

- Click the **up arrow** to move a tweet earlier in the thread
- Click the **down arrow** to move a tweet later in the thread

The thread position updates instantly, and you can preview the final order before scheduling.

## Auto-Engagements

![X Auto Eng](/images/x-auto-eng.jpg)

Automatically interact with your own tweets after they publish to boost initial visibility. Twitter supports these auto-engagement types:

| Type             | What it does                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-Like**    | Connected profiles like your tweet                                           |
| **Auto-Retweet** | Retweet from another connected Twitter account                               |
| **Quote Tweet**  | Retweet with your own commentary from another account                        |
| **Auto-Reply**   | Add a first reply (great for additional context, links, or a call-to-action) |

Configure timing from **immediately** after posting up to **24 hours** later. Staggering engagements across different delays helps them appear more natural.

<Note>
  Auto-engagements are available for **Pro** plan workspaces and above. Starter workspaces can only add auto-engagements from the same account as the tweet author.
