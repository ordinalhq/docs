Twitter is built for real-time conversation. In Ordinal, you can schedule individual tweets, build multi-tweet threads, create polls, and coordinate engagement—all timed to publish when your audience is most active.

## Overview

Twitter supports both scheduling and engagement profiles. Most users connect for scheduling, but you can also connect an engagement profile to like, retweet, and reply directly from Ordinal.

| Profile type | What you can do |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Scheduling** | Post tweets, threads, polls, media |
| **Engagement** | Like, retweet, reply, view timeline |

<Tip>
Connect the same account as both scheduling and engagement if you want full publishing and interaction capabilities.
</Tip>

## Connecting Twitter

**For scheduling**: **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling** → Twitter/X

**For engagement**: **Settings → Profiles → Engagement** → Twitter/X (doesn't count toward your plan limit)

Twitter tokens rarely expire on their own, but will reset if you change your password or revoke app permissions.

## What you can post

| Content | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Text tweets | ✅ | 280 chars standard, 25,000 for Premium |
| Images | ✅ | Up to 4 per tweet |
| GIFs | ✅ | Animated |
| Video | ✅ | Up to 2:20 |
| Polls | ✅ | 2–4 options, 1 hour to 7 days |
| Threads | ✅ | Multi-tweet sequences |

### Threads

Threads let you tell longer stories across multiple connected tweets. Each tweet in the thread can have its own media.

To create a thread:
1. Write your first tweet
2. Click **Add Tweet** to add the next
3. Continue adding tweets
4. Schedule—all tweets publish in sequence

Threads work well for tutorials, stories, and breaking down complex topics. Each tweet should stand alone while contributing to the whole.

### Polls

Polls are a quick way to engage your audience. Set your question, add 2–4 answer options, and choose how long the poll runs (1 hour to 7 days). Polls schedule like regular tweets.

## Character limits

| Account type | Limit |
|--------------|-------|
| Standard | 280 characters |
| Twitter Premium | 25,000 characters |

Ordinal shows a real-time counter that adjusts based on your account type.

## Media specifications

| Type | Formats | Size limit | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Images | JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP | 5 MB | Up to 4 per tweet |
| Videos | MP4, MOV | 512 MB | Up to 2:20 |
| GIFs | GIF | 15 MB | Animated |

## Common issues

**Rate limit exceeded**: Twitter limits API calls. Wait 15 minutes and avoid scheduling many posts at the exact same time.

**Duplicate content blocked**: Twitter rejects identical tweets. Vary your content or wait before reposting.

**Thread out of order**: Double-check your thread sequence before scheduling. Editing after scheduling can cause issues.

## Tips

- **Threads outperform single tweets** for in-depth content
- **Tweets with images get more engagement** than text-only
- **1–2 hashtags is optimal**—more can hurt reach
- **Peak times vary**, but 8–10 AM and 6–9 PM are common starting points
