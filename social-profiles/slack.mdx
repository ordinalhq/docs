Slack scheduling keeps your team in the loop without the manual work. Schedule announcements, content alerts, or recurring updates to any channel—written and timed alongside the rest of your content calendar.

## Connecting Slack

Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/scheduling/slack), select Slack, and sign in to your workspace. Choose which channels Ordinal can post to—each channel appears as a selectable profile when creating posts.

| Requirement | Details                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Connection  | OAuth via Slack                    |
| Permissions | Post messages to selected channels |
| Sender      | Ordinal app (bot)                  |

<Tip>
  The Ordinal app must be invited to private channels. Type `/invite @Ordinal` in the channel first.

## Drafting a Slack Message

### What you can post

| Feature                     | Supported | Notes                                |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Text messages               | ✅         | Up to 40,000 characters              |
| [Attachments](#attachments) | ✅         | 1 image or video per message         |
| Formatted text              | ✅         | Bold, italic, code, links, lists     |
| [Mentions](#mentions)       | ✅         | @here, @channel, users, and channels |
| Link previews               | ✅         | Slack unfurls links automatically    |

### Formatting

The editor supports Slack's markdown-style formatting:

- **Bold**: Use the toolbar or `Cmd/Ctrl + B`
- **Italic**: Use the toolbar or `Cmd/Ctrl + I`
- **Code**: Inline code formatting
- **Links**: Paste URLs or use the link button
- **Lists**: Bullet and numbered lists
- **Emoji**: Type `:emoji_name:` or use the emoji picker

Formatting converts to Slack's native syntax when published, so your messages look native in the channel.

### Mentions

Tag users, channels, and broadcast to everyone:

| Mention         | What it does                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `@here`         | Notifies active members in the channel |
| `@channel`      | Notifies all members in the channel    |
| `@everyone`     | Notifies everyone in the workspace     |
| `<@USER_ID>`    | Mentions a specific user               |
| `<#CHANNEL_ID>` | Links to another channel               |

<Note>
  User and channel mentions require Slack IDs (not display names). You can find these in Slack by right-clicking a user or channel and copying the link.

## Attachments

You can attach **one image or video** per Slack message.

| Spec           | Limit                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Files per post | 1                       |
| Formats        | JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4, MOV |

Drag and drop files into the editor, paste from clipboard, or use the attachment button. If you need to share multiple files, consider posting them separately or linking to a shared folder.

## Common Issues

**Channel not appearing**: The Ordinal app must be invited to private channels. Type `/invite @Ordinal` in the channel.

**Can't connect**: You may need workspace admin permission to add apps. Check with your Slack admin.

**Messages not posting**: Verify the channel still exists and Ordinal hasn't been removed from your workspace.

**Formatting looks wrong**: Some advanced formatting may render differently depending on Slack client versions.

## Use Cases

- **Scheduled announcements**: Company or community updates, policy changes, etc.
- **Recurring messages**: Weekly reminders, monthly reports, etc.
