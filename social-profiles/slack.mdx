Slack integrates with Ordinal in two ways: schedule messages to channels, and receive notifications about your Ordinal activity. Most teams use both.

## Overview

| Integration | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Scheduling** | Post messages to Slack channels on a schedule |
| **Notifications** | Get alerts when posts publish, fail, or need approval |
| **Slack Boost** | Automatically share published social posts with your team |

These are separate integrations—you can use one, two, or all three depending on your workflow.

## Scheduling messages

Schedule messages to Slack channels for team announcements, content alerts, or recurring updates.

### Connecting for scheduling

Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select Slack, sign in to your workspace, and choose which channels Ordinal can post to. Each channel appears as a selectable profile when creating posts.

### What you can post

| Content | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Text messages | ✅ |
| Images | ✅ |
| Files | ✅ |
| Links with preview | ✅ |
| Formatted text | ✅ |

Slack formatting works—bold, italic, code blocks, links, and emoji all publish as expected.

### Use cases

- Scheduled team announcements
- Alerting the team when social content goes live
- Recurring messages (weekly updates, daily standups)

## Notifications

Get notified in Slack when things happen in Ordinal—no need to constantly check the dashboard.

### Connecting for notifications

Go to **Settings → Slack** and click **Connect Slack for Notifications**. Choose a channel and select which events to send.

### Notification types

| Event | What you're notified about |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Post published | Scheduled posts that went live successfully |
| Post failed | Posts that failed to publish (important!) |
| Approval requested | Content submitted for your review |
| Comments | When you're tagged in a comment |

<Tip>
At minimum, enable "Post failed" notifications. Catching failures quickly lets you fix issues before your content calendar falls behind.

## Slack Boost

Slack Boost automatically shares your published social posts to a Slack channel, making it easy for your team to engage.

### How it works

1. You publish a social post (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
2. Ordinal sends a message to your Slack Boost channel
3. Your team sees it and can click through to engage

This coordinates team amplification without manual effort.

### Setting up Boost

Go to **Settings → Slack** and click **Add Slack Boost Channel**. Choose a channel and configure:

- **Auto-post**: Boost all published posts automatically
- **Manual**: Choose which posts to boost individually

When enabled, you can also customize the boost message on a per-post basis.

## Permissions

When you connect Slack, Ordinal requests permission to post messages, view channels, and post as a bot. The Ordinal app appears as the sender for scheduled messages and notifications.

## Common issues

**Can't connect**: You may need workspace admin permission to add apps. Check with your Slack admin.

**Channel not appearing**: The Ordinal app must be invited to private channels. Type `/invite @Ordinal` in the channel.

**Messages not posting**: Verify the channel exists and Ordinal hasn't been removed from your workspace.

## Tips

- **Separate channels for different purposes**—announcements vs. notifications vs. boost
- **Time messages for when people are online**—scheduled messages at 3 AM don't help anyone
- **Use Boost for high-priority content**—not every post needs team amplification
