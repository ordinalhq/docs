YouTube integration is for **Shorts only**—vertical videos under 60 seconds. Standard long-form YouTube videos aren't currently supported.

## Overview

Shorts are YouTube's answer to TikTok and Reels. They appear in a dedicated Shorts feed and can drive significant reach. In Ordinal, you can schedule Shorts with titles, descriptions, and visibility settings.

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Format | Vertical (9:16) |
| Length | 15–60 seconds |
| Account | YouTube channel with Google account |

Your channel must be verified (phone verification) and in good standing—channels with active strikes may have limited API access.

## Connecting YouTube

Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select YouTube, sign in with Google, and choose your channel. If you manage multiple channels, you can connect each as a separate profile.

YouTube tokens can expire based on Google's policies. You'll see a warning when reconnection is needed.

## What makes a Short

YouTube classifies a video as a Short when it's:
- Vertical (9:16 aspect ratio)
- 60 seconds or less
- At least 15 seconds

Videos that don't meet these criteria won't appear in the Shorts feed.

## Video specifications

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Formats | MP4, WebM |
| Aspect ratio | 9:16 (vertical) |
| Resolution | 1080×1920 recommended |
| Length | 15–60 seconds |
| File size | 500 MB maximum |

## Titles and descriptions

**Titles**: Up to 100 characters. Include relevant keywords—Shorts are searchable on YouTube.

**Descriptions**: Up to 5,000 characters. Add hashtags (including `#Shorts`), links, and calls to action.

<Tip>
Including `#Shorts` in your title or description helps YouTube categorize your video correctly, though it's not strictly required for videos that meet the format specs.
</Tip>

## Visibility options

| Setting | Who can see |
|---------|-------------|
| Public | Anyone on YouTube |
| Unlisted | Only people with the direct link |
| Private | Only you |

Set visibility when scheduling. You can change it later in YouTube Studio.

## API limitations

These features require YouTube Studio and aren't available in Ordinal:

| Feature | Available |
|---------|-----------|
| Shorts (under 60s) | ✅ |
| Standard videos | ❌ |
| Community posts | ❌ |
| Playlists | ❌ |
| End screens | ❌ |
| Cards | ❌ |
| Custom thumbnails | Limited |

## Common issues

**Channel not appearing**: Make sure you're signed into the correct Google account and your channel is verified with no active strikes.

**Video not classified as a Short**: Must be vertical (9:16), between 15–60 seconds, and meet resolution requirements.

**Upload failed**: Check file size, format, and length. Copyright issues with audio can also cause failures.

## Tips

- **Optimize for mobile**—Shorts are consumed on phones
- **Hook viewers immediately**—first 3 seconds determine whether they keep watching
- **Post daily**—consistency helps build momentum on the Shorts shelf
- **Add a CTA**—encourage subscriptions or channel visits
