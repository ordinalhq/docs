Facebook Pages are still one of the best ways to reach an established audience. In Ordinal, you can schedule feed posts, publish Reels, and manage multiple pages from one place.

## Overview

Facebook Pages represent businesses, brands, organizations, or public figures. When you connect a page, posts appear from the page (not your personal account), and you get access to page-level analytics.

<Warning>
  Personal profiles can't be connected due to Facebook API restrictions. This applies to all third-party scheduling tools, not just Ordinal.

## Connecting Facebook

Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/scheduling/facebook), click **Connect Account**, select Facebook, and sign in. Choose which pages to connect - you can connect multiple pages, and each appears as a separate profile.

| Requirement  | Details                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Account type | Facebook Page (not personal profile) |
| Access level | Admin or Editor role on the Page     |
| Page status  | Must be published (not draft)        |

### Business Suite Users

If you manage pages through Meta Business Suite, you may need to authorize Ordinal in **Business Settings → Connected Apps**. Some Business Suite configurations require explicit app permissions.

### Drafting & Formatting

The Facebook editor supports rich formatting through Unicode characters, which render as **bold** and _italic_ on Facebook:

- **Bold / Italic**: Use the toolbar buttons or press `Cmd/Ctrl + B` for bold and `Cmd/Ctrl + I` for italic
- **Hashtags**: Type `#` followed by your tag - they'll automatically link to Facebook search
- **Mentions**: Type `@` and search for Facebook Pages to tag them in your post
- **Links**: Paste URLs directly - Facebook auto-generates a preview with image, title, and description

Facebook posts can be up to **2,200 characters**. The character counter updates in real-time as you type.

### Post Preview

As you draft, the editor shows a live preview that matches how your content will appear on Facebook - including your page name and profile picture.

### Tagging Pages

Tag other Facebook Pages in your posts to increase visibility and notify them:

1. Type `@` in your post
2. Search for the Page by name
3. Select from the suggestions dropdown

Mentions become clickable links when published and may notify the tagged Page.

## Post Types

Use the **Feed / Reel** dropdown at the top of the editor to switch between post types.

## Auto-Engagements

Automatically add a first comment to your posts after they publish - great for CTAs, additional links, or hashtags you don't want in the main post.

| Type             | Supported | Notes                                      |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Auto-Comment** | ✅         | Add a comment from the same profile as the post author |
| Auto-Like        | ❌         | Not available for Facebook                 |
| Auto-Repost      | ❌         | Not available for Facebook                 |

Configure timing from **immediately** after posting up to **24 hours** later.

<Note>
