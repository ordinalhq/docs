Facebook in Ordinal is for **Pages only**—the API doesn't support personal profiles. You can schedule posts, publish Reels, and manage multiple pages from one place.

## Overview

Facebook Pages represent businesses, brands, organizations, or public figures. When you connect a page, posts appear from the page (not your personal account), and you get access to page-level analytics.

<Warning>
Personal profiles can't be connected due to Facebook API restrictions. This applies to all third-party scheduling tools, not just Ordinal.
</Warning>

If you manage multiple pages, you can connect them all. Each page appears as a separate profile in Ordinal.

## Connecting Facebook

Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select Facebook, sign in, and choose which pages to connect. You need Admin or Editor access to a page to connect it.

Tokens expire roughly every 60 days. You'll see a warning when it's time to reconnect.

### Business Suite users

If you manage pages through Meta Business Suite, you may need to authorize Ordinal in **Business Settings → Connected Apps**. Some Business Suite configurations require explicit app permissions.

## What you can post

| Content | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Text posts | ✅ | |
| Images | ✅ | Single or multiple |
| Video | ✅ | Up to 240 minutes |
| Reels | ✅ | 3–90 seconds, vertical |
| Links | ✅ | With auto-generated preview |
| Events | ❌ | |
| Live video | ❌ | |

### Link previews

When you include a URL, Facebook auto-generates a preview with image, title, and description. You can customize the title and description in some cases, or choose to hide the preview entirely.

### Cross-posting to Instagram

If your Facebook Page is linked to an Instagram Business account, you can post to both simultaneously. Select both platforms when creating a post and customize content for each.

## Media specifications

| Type | Formats | Size limit | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Images | JPG, PNG | 4 MB | 1200×630 recommended |
| Videos | MP4, MOV | 4 GB | Up to 240 minutes |
| Reels | MP4 | 1 GB | 3–90 seconds, 9:16 vertical |

<Tip>
Native video uploads perform significantly better than sharing YouTube links. Upload directly for maximum reach.

## Analytics

View page performance in **Analytics → Facebook**: reach, impressions, engagement, video views, and follower growth.

## Common issues

**Page not appearing**: You need Admin or Editor access to connect a page. Regular followers or employees without page roles won't see it.

**Page in draft mode**: The page must be published, not in draft. Publish it in Facebook settings first.

**Permission errors**: Try disconnecting and reconnecting. Make sure you accept all requested permissions during authorization.

**Page restricted**: Check the Page Quality tab in Facebook for any policy violations affecting your page.

## Tips

- **Post 1–2 times daily**—more frequent posting can decrease per-post reach
- **Native video outperforms external links** significantly
- **Reels get higher organic reach** than static posts
- **Respond to comments**—engagement signals help visibility
