Social profiles are the accounts you connect to Ordinal—your LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms. Once connected, you can schedule posts, track performance, and manage everything from one place.

![Setting Social Profiles](/images/setting-socialprofiles.jpg)

## Overview

You can connect as many accounts as your plan allows, including multiple accounts from the same platform. This is useful for managing different brands, clients, or separating personal and professional presence. Ordinal supports two types of connections:

**Scheduling profiles** let you publish content. Schedule posts, upload media, and track analytics. These count toward your plan's profile limit.

**Engagement profiles** let you interact without publishing—like posts, leave comments, reply to mentions. Available for LinkedIn and Twitter/X.

<Tip>
  If you're unsure which profiles to connect first, start with the platforms where you post most frequently. You can always add more later.

## Connecting profiles

Connect accounts in [**Settings → Profiles**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles). Most platforms use OAuth - you sign in once and Ordinal handles authentication from there.

Consider connecting profiles for:

- Platforms where you post regularly
- Accounts you want to cross-post to
- Channels where you want unified analytics

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many profiles can I connect?">
    This depends on your plan. Scheduling profiles count toward your limit; engagement profiles don't. See [subscription plans](/account/subscription-plans) for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I connect personal and business accounts from the same platform?">
    Yes. Each account appears as a separate profile. You can connect multiple LinkedIn profiles, multiple Twitter accounts, etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I disconnect a profile?">
    Scheduled posts to that profile won't publish. The posts remain in Ordinal—you can reconnect and they'll be ready to go.
