Discord works differently from other platforms in Ordinal. Instead of connecting an account, you create **webhooks** in Discord and add them to Ordinal. Messages post to specific channels through those webhooks.

## Overview

Webhooks are channel-specific URLs that accept incoming messages. You create them in Discord, give them a name and avatar, and paste the URL into Ordinal. No Discord login required in Ordinal—you control exactly which channels can receive scheduled messages.

| How it works | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| Connection method | Webhook URL (not OAuth) |
| Sender appearance | Webhook name and avatar |
| Scope | One webhook per channel |

This means:
- You decide which channels get a webhook
- Each webhook posts to exactly one channel
- The webhook's name and avatar appear as the message sender
- Anyone with the webhook URL can post to that channel (keep it private)

## Creating a webhook in Discord

1. Open your Discord server
2. Go to **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
3. Click **New Webhook**
4. Set the name (this appears as the sender, e.g., "Ordinal Updates")
5. Upload an avatar image
6. Select which channel this webhook posts to
7. Click **Copy Webhook URL**

Keep this URL private—it's essentially a posting key for that channel.

## Adding the webhook to Ordinal

Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select Discord, paste your webhook URL, and give it a name. The webhook appears as a profile you can select when creating posts.

To post to multiple channels, create a separate webhook for each channel in Discord and add each to Ordinal.

## What you can post

| Content | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Text messages | ✅ |
| Images | ✅ |
| Videos | ✅ |
| Rich embeds | ✅ |
| @mentions | Limited (requires user/role IDs) |
| Reactions | ❌ |

### Rich embeds

Embeds create visually distinct messages with custom titles, descriptions, colors, and thumbnails. Use them for announcements that should stand out from regular chat.

### Message limits

- 2,000 characters per message
- Up to 10 embeds per message
- 8 MB maximum file size

## Common issues

**Webhook not working**: The webhook may have been deleted in Discord. Create a new one and update it in Ordinal.

**Messages not appearing**: Verify you're checking the correct channel—each webhook posts to exactly one channel.

**Embeds not displaying**: The webhook needs "Embed Links" permission in the channel. Check channel settings in Discord.

## Tips

- **Name webhooks clearly**—"Product Updates" or "Social Alerts" makes it obvious what's posting
- **Use custom avatars**—helps messages look intentional, not like spam
- **Don't over-automate**—too many automated posts can feel impersonal to community members
- **One purpose per webhook**—keeps things organized

## Use cases

- Product announcements and release notes
- Sharing new social content with your community
- Event reminders and countdowns
- Weekly community updates
