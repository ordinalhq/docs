Discord is where communities live—and scheduled announcements keep them engaged. Instead of connecting an account, you create **webhooks** in Discord and add them to Ordinal. Messages post to specific channels through those webhooks, perfect for product updates, event reminders, and recurring community content.

## Overview

Webhooks are channel-specific URLs that accept incoming messages. You create them in Discord, give them a name and avatar, and paste the URL into Ordinal. No Discord login required—you control exactly which channels can receive scheduled messages.

| How it works | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| Connection method | Webhook URL (not OAuth) |
| Sender appearance | Webhook name and avatar |
| Scope | One webhook per channel |

This means:
- You decide which channels get a webhook
- Each webhook posts to exactly one channel
- The webhook's name and avatar appear as the message sender
- Anyone with the webhook URL can post to that channel (keep it private)

## Creating a Webhook in Discord

1. Open your Discord server
2. Go to **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
3. Click **New Webhook**
4. Set the name (this appears as the sender, e.g., "Ordinal Updates")
5. Upload an avatar image
6. Select which channel this webhook posts to
7. Click **Copy Webhook URL**

Keep this URL private—it's essentially a posting key for that channel.

<Tip>
  Name webhooks clearly (like "Product Updates" or "Social Alerts") so it's obvious what's posting. Use a custom avatar to help messages look intentional, not like spam.
</Tip>

## Adding the Webhook to Ordinal

Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/scheduling/discord), select Discord, paste your webhook URL, and give it a name. The webhook appears as a profile you can select when creating posts.

To post to multiple channels, create a separate webhook for each channel in Discord and add each to Ordinal.

## Drafting a Discord Message

### What you can post

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Text messages | ✅ | Up to 2,000 characters |
| [Attachments](#attachments) | ✅ | Up to 3 files, 10MB each |
| Formatted text | ✅ | Headings, bold, italic, underline, code, links, lists |
| [Mentions](#mentions) | ✅ | @here, @everyone, users, roles |
| Link previews | ✅ | Discord unfurls links automatically |

### Formatting

The editor supports Discord's markdown formatting:

- **Headings**: H1 and H2 for structure
- **Bold**: Use the toolbar or `Cmd/Ctrl + B`
- **Italic**: Use the toolbar or `Cmd/Ctrl + I`
- **Underline**: Use the toolbar or `Cmd/Ctrl + U`
- **Code**: Inline code formatting
- **Links**: Paste URLs or use the link button—Discord displays them as clickable or with `[text](url)` syntax
- **Lists**: Bullet and numbered lists
- **Emoji**: Type `:emoji_name:` or use the emoji picker

Formatting converts to Discord's native markdown when published.

### Mentions

Tag users, roles, and broadcast to everyone:

| Mention | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `@here` | Notifies active members in the channel |
| `@everyone` | Notifies all members in the server |
| `<@USER_ID>` | Mentions a specific user |
| `<@&ROLE_ID>` | Mentions a specific role |

<Note>
  User and role mentions require Discord IDs (not display names). You can find these by enabling Developer Mode in Discord settings, then right-clicking a user or role.

## Attachments

You can attach **up to 3 files** per Discord message.

| Spec | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Files per post | 3 maximum |
| File size | 10MB per file |
| Formats | JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4, MOV |

Drag and drop files into the editor, paste from clipboard, or use the attachment button. Each attachment must have a unique filename.

## Common Issues

**Webhook not working**: The webhook may have been deleted in Discord. Create a new one and update it in Ordinal.

**Messages not appearing**: Verify you're checking the correct channel—each webhook posts to exactly one channel.

**Duplicate attachment error**: Each attachment in a post must have a unique filename. Rename files before uploading if needed.

**File too large**: Discord webhooks have a 10MB file size limit. Compress your files or use a link instead.

## Use Cases

- **Product announcements**: Release notes, feature launches, changelog updates
- **Community updates**: Event reminders, weekly roundups, server news
- **Content sharing**: Notify when new social posts, blog articles, or videos go live
- **Automated alerts**: Scheduled reminders, countdowns, recurring messages
