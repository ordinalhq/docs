## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot not appearing in server">
    Ensure you have "Manage Server" permissions to add the Ordinal bot. Ask a server admin if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't post to channel">
    Check channel permissions. The Ordinal bot needs "Send Messages" and "Embed Links" permissions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Embeds not displaying">
    Verify "Embed Links" permission is enabled for the Ordinal bot in channel settings.
  </Accordion>
