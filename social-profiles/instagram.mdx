Instagram is a visual-first platform. In Ordinal, you can schedule feed posts, Reels, carousels, and Stories—plus use Instagram-specific features like first comments and cover photos.

## Overview

Instagram requires a **Business or Creator account** (not personal) and connects through Facebook. This is a Meta API requirement—your Instagram must be linked to a Facebook Page, and you need admin access to that page.

If you have a personal account, convert it in Instagram: **Settings → Account → Switch to Professional Account**.

<Note>
The Facebook connection is just for authentication. You don't need to post to Facebook—it's how Instagram's API works.
</Note>

## Connecting Instagram

Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select Instagram, and sign in with Facebook. Choose the Facebook Page linked to your Instagram, authorize Ordinal, and your Instagram profile appears in your connected accounts.

Tokens expire roughly every 60 days. You'll see a warning when it's time to reconnect.

## What you can post

| Content | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Feed posts | ✅ | Single image or video |
| Carousels | ✅ | Up to 10 images/videos |
| Reels | ✅ | 15–90 seconds, vertical |
| Stories | ⚠️ | Single image only, no stickers or polls |

### Story limitations

Instagram's API restricts Stories to single images without interactive elements. For polls, questions, countdowns, or stickers, post Stories directly in the Instagram app.

## Instagram-specific features

**First Comment**: Schedule a comment to publish immediately after your post. Many creators use this for hashtags to keep captions cleaner.

**Cover Photo**: Choose a custom cover frame for Reels—pick from the video or upload your own image.

**Share to Feed**: Control whether Reels appear in both your profile grid and the Reels tab, or just Reels.

**Location Tagging**: Add a location to increase discoverability. You can set a default location in your workspace settings if you frequently tag the same place.

## Media specifications

| Content | Formats | Dimensions | Limits |
|---------|---------|------------|--------|
| Images | JPG, PNG | 1080×1080 (square), 1080×1350 (portrait) | Min 320px wide |
| Feed videos | MP4, MOV | Various | 60 seconds, 100 MB |
| Reels | MP4 | 1080×1920 (9:16) | 15–90 seconds |
| Carousels | Mixed | Consistent ratio recommended | Up to 10 items |

## Caption limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Characters | 2,200 |
| Hashtags | 30 maximum |

<Tip>
Put hashtags in your first comment instead of the caption. It keeps your post looking cleaner and doesn't affect discoverability.

## Common issues

**Business account required**: Personal accounts can't connect. Switch to Business or Creator in Instagram settings.

**Page not linked**: Your Instagram must be linked to a Facebook Page. Check this in Instagram under **Settings → Account → Linked Accounts**.

**Post failed**: Common causes are unsupported aspect ratios, videos over 60 seconds (for feed), captions over 2,200 characters, or 30+ hashtags.

## Tips

- **Reels get higher organic reach** than static posts—prioritize them if reach is your goal
- **Carousels increase time on post**, which signals quality to the algorithm
- **Consistent aesthetics matter**—plan your grid appearance
- **Test posting times**—common peaks are 11 AM–1 PM and 7–9 PM, but your audience may differ
