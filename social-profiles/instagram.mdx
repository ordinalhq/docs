## Drafting an Instagram Post

### What you can post

| Feature                   | Supported | Notes                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [Feed posts](#feed-posts) | ✅         | Single image/video or carousel                  |
| [Carousels](#feed-posts)  | ✅         | Up to 10 images/videos                          |
| [Reels](#reels)           | ✅         | Single video, up to 15 minutes                  |
| [Stories](#stories)       | ⚠️        | Up to 10 images/videos, no interactive elements |

### Drafting & Formatting

The Instagram editor supports rich formatting through Unicode characters:

- **Bold / Italic**: Use the toolbar buttons or press `Cmd/Ctrl + B` for bold and `Cmd/Ctrl + I` for italic
- **Hashtags**: Type `#` followed by your tag—Instagram allows up to 30 per post (tracked in the editor)
- **Mentions**: Type `@` followed by an Instagram handle to mention someone
- **Links**: Instagram captions don't support clickable links, but you can include URLs as text

Captions can be up to **2,200 characters**. The character counter updates in real-time as you type.

### Post Preview

As you draft your post, the editor shows a live preview that matches how your content will appear on Instagram.

For planning your profile aesthetic, switch to **Grid Preview** to see how your new post will fit into your existing Instagram grid. This helps you maintain a consistent visual style across your profile.

### Photo Options

**Photo tagging**: Tag users directly on your images to increase engagement and notify them:

1. Add images to your post
2. Open the **Tags** option
3. Click anywhere on the image where you want the tag to appear
4. Enter the Instagram handle

<Note>
  Photo tagging is only available for images in Feed posts. Videos in Feed posts and all Reels content use text-based tagging instead.
</Note>

### Instagram-Specific Features

**Location**: Add a location to Feed posts to increase discoverability. Search for any place and it will appear on your published post.

**Collaborators**: Invite up to **3 other Instagram accounts** to co-author your post. When published, collaborators receive a DM to accept the invitation, and the post appears on both profiles.

**Cover Photo** (Reels only): Choose a custom thumbnail for your Reel—select a frame from the video or upload your own image.

**Share to Feed** (Reels only): Control whether your Reel appears in both your profile grid and the Reels tab, or just in Reels.

## Post Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Feed Posts">
    Feed posts appear in your profile grid and followers' feeds. They support single images, single videos, or carousels.

    | Spec       | Limit                                |
    | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | Formats    | JPG only (PNG auto-converted)        |
    | Image size | 8MB max per image                    |
    | Max pixels | 36 million per image                 |
    | Per post   | Up to 10 images/videos (carousel)    |
    | Aspect     | 4:5 (portrait) to 1.91:1 (landscape) |

    **Videos in Feed:**

    | Spec     | Limit            |
    | -------- | ---------------- |
    | Formats  | MP4, MOV         |
    | Duration | Up to 60 seconds |
    | Aspect   | 4:5 to 16:9      |

    Ordinal automatically compresses videos larger than 125MB or wider than 1920px to meet Instagram's requirements.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reels">
    Reels are short-form vertical videos that appear in the Reels tab and can optionally show in your grid.

    | Spec     | Limit                     |
    | -------- | ------------------------- |
    | Formats  | MP4, MOV                  |
    | Duration | Up to 15 minutes          |
    | Per post | 1 video only              |
    | Aspect   | 0.01:1 to 10:1 (flexible) |

    **Reel-specific options:**

    - **Cover Photo**: Upload a custom thumbnail or select a frame from the video
    - **Share to Feed**: Toggle whether the Reel appears in your profile grid

    <Tip>
      Reels consistently get higher organic reach than static posts. If growing your audience is a priority, prioritize Reels.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stories">
    Stories are ephemeral content that disappears after 24 hours.

    | Spec     | Limit                  |
    | -------- | ---------------------- |
    | Formats  | JPG, PNG, MP4, MOV     |
    | Per post | Up to 10 images/videos |
    | Duration | 3–60 seconds (videos)  |
    | Image    | 8MB max                |

    **Story limitations:**

    Instagram's API restricts what can be scheduled for Stories:

    - ❌ No stickers, polls, questions, or countdowns
    - ❌ No link stickers
    - ❌ No music
    - ❌ No captions (the editor is hidden for Stories)

    For interactive Stories, post directly in the Instagram app.

## Auto-Engagements

![Instagram Auto Eng](/images/Instagram-auto-eng.jpg)

Schedule a **first comment** to publish automatically after your post goes live. This is the only auto-engagement type available for Instagram due to API limitations.

| Type              | What it does                                                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First Comment** | Add a comment immediately after posting (great for hashtags or CTAs) |

<Tip>
  Many creators put their hashtags in the first comment to keep captions cleaner. It doesn't affect discoverability.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Instagram's API doesn't support auto-likes or auto-reposts. Only first comments can be scheduled.
