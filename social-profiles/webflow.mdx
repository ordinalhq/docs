Webflow integration lets you publish blog posts directly to your website's CMS. Write content in Ordinal, schedule it alongside your social posts, and push to your blog without logging into Webflow.

## Overview

This integration works with **Webflow CMS collections**—typically your blog or resources section. It doesn't modify static pages, site design, or ecommerce products.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Webflow plan | CMS access required (not available on free plans) |
| Permissions | Editor or higher on the site |
| What it publishes | CMS collection items (blog posts, articles) |

If you're not sure whether your site has CMS access, check if you have a "CMS Collections" section in Webflow's designer.

## Connecting Webflow

Go to **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**, select Webflow, sign in, and choose your site and collection. During setup, you'll map fields between Ordinal and your Webflow collection.

## Field mapping

Ordinal maps its content to your Webflow collection fields:

| Ordinal | Webflow (typical) |
|---------|-------------------|
| Title | Name / Title |
| Body | Post Body / Rich Text |
| Slug | Slug |
| Publish date | Published On |

### Custom fields

If your collection has additional fields—author, category, featured image, tags—you can configure mapping during setup or later in Settings. Ordinal can populate any text, reference, or image field in your collection.

<Tip>
Review your Webflow collection structure before connecting. Knowing which fields are required helps avoid publishing errors.
</Tip>

## Writing content

The Ordinal editor supports rich text formatting that translates to Webflow:

- Headings (H1–H6)
- Bold, italic, underline
- Links
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Block quotes
- Images
- Embedded content

Content formats correctly when published to Webflow's rich text fields.

## Draft vs. Published

When scheduling, choose how the item appears:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Draft** | Creates the CMS item as a draft. Review in Webflow before going live. |
| **Published** | Creates and publishes immediately. It's live on your site. |

Use Draft mode if you want to review formatting in Webflow, add elements Ordinal doesn't support, or get final approval before publishing.

## Slugs

Slugs are auto-generated from your title but can be customized. Each slug must be unique within your collection—duplicates cause publish failures.

<Note>
Changing a slug after publishing creates a new URL. If you have existing links to the post, they'll break unless you set up redirects in Webflow.
</Note>

## API limitations

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Blog posts (CMS items) | ✅ |
| Static page content | ❌ |
| Ecommerce products | ❌ |
| Site settings | ❌ |
| Design changes | ❌ |

## Common issues

**Site not appearing**: Your Webflow site needs CMS access. Free sites without CMS aren't connectable.

**Collection not syncing**: Verify your collection has the required fields and API access is enabled in Webflow site settings.

**Field mapping errors**: Ensure field types match—text to text, rich text to rich text. Mismatched types can cause silent failures.

**Publishing failed**: Check that required Webflow fields are populated, the slug is unique, and you haven't hit CMS item limits.

## Use cases

- **Synchronized launches**: Draft a blog post, schedule social promotion, publish everything together
- **Content repurposing**: Expand Twitter threads or LinkedIn posts into full articles
- **Team workflow**: Use Ordinal's approval flow for blog content before it goes live
