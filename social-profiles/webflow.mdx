Webflow integration brings your blog into Ordinal. Write content in the same place you manage social, schedule posts alongside your other channels, and coordinate blog launches with social promotion—all without logging into Webflow separately.

## Overview

This integration works with **Webflow CMS collections**—typically your blog or resources section. Unlike social channels, Webflow posts are full articles with rich formatting, custom CMS fields, and unique URLs.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Webflow plan | CMS access required (not available on free plans) |
| Permissions | Editor or higher on the site |
| What it publishes | CMS collection items (blog posts, articles) |

<Note>
  This integration doesn't modify static pages, site design, or ecommerce products—only CMS collection items.
</Note>

## Connecting Webflow

Go to [**Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/profiles/scheduling/webflow), select Webflow, and sign in with your Webflow account. You'll then:

1. Choose the **site** you want to publish to
2. Select the **CMS collection** (usually "Blog Posts" or similar)
3. Map the **title** and **body** fields to your collection's corresponding fields
4. Set the **base URL** where your blog posts appear (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/blog`)

Ordinal creates an asset folder in your Webflow site to store images and files uploaded through the editor.

<Tip>
  Review your Webflow collection structure before connecting. Knowing which fields are required helps avoid publishing errors later.
</Tip>

## Writing Content

The Webflow editor in Ordinal is a full rich text editor—more like a document than a social post. You'll find two tabs:

### Blog Copy

This is where you write your article. The editor supports:

- **Headings**: H1 through H6 for document structure
- **Text formatting**: Bold, italic, underline, and code
- **Lists**: Bullet points and numbered lists
- **Block quotes**: For callouts and citations
- **Links**: Inline hyperlinks with full URL support
- **Images**: Drag and drop or paste images directly into your content
- **Code blocks**: For technical content

Type `/` to open the slash command menu for quick formatting options. Blog content can be up to **40,000 characters**—plenty for long-form articles.

### How it publishes

Ordinal converts your content to HTML that Webflow understands. Images are uploaded to your Webflow asset folder and embedded with proper formatting classes. The result looks native to your Webflow site's design.

## CMS Fields

Switch to the **CMS Fields** tab to populate your collection's custom fields. Ordinal automatically detects your Webflow collection schema and displays inputs for each field.

### Supported field types

| Field Type | How it works in Ordinal |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Plain Text | Single or multi-line text input |
| Rich Text | Markdown editor that converts to HTML |
| Image | Upload a single image |
| Multi-Image | Upload up to 25 images (great for galleries) |
| File | Upload any file type |
| Link / Video Link | URL input with validation |
| Number | Numeric input with min/max/precision validation |
| Option | Dropdown selector from your Webflow options |
| Reference | Select from related collection items |
| Multi-Reference | Select multiple related items |
| Switch | True/false toggle |
| Color | Hex color picker |
| Date/Time | Date picker with optional time |
| Email | Email input with validation |
| Phone | Phone number input |

### Slug field

The slug determines your post's URL (e.g., `/blog/your-post-slug`). Ordinal auto-generates slugs from your title, but you can customize them. Click **Sync with Blog Title** to regenerate from the current title.

<Warning>
  Each slug must be unique within your collection. Duplicate slugs cause publish failures.
</Warning>

### Refreshing fields

If you update your Webflow collection schema (adding new fields, changing requirements), click the refresh link in the CMS Fields tab to pull the latest structure. This ensures Ordinal stays in sync with your Webflow setup.

## Previewing Your Post

Before publishing, you can preview exactly how your post will appear on your site. Click **Preview on Webflow** and choose a preview mode:

| Mode | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Live Site** | Temporarily publishes to your live site for 3 minutes, then auto-deletes |
| **Designer** | Creates a draft in Webflow's Designer for 3 minutes, then auto-deletes |

Use **Live Site** preview to see the final result with your site's styling. Use **Designer** preview if you want to inspect or tweak the content in Webflow before it goes live (requires appropriate Webflow permissions).

<Note>
  Preview posts are automatically removed after 3 minutes. You can also manually unpublish early by clicking **Unpublish Preview**.
</Note>

## Publishing

When you schedule a Webflow post, choose how it should appear:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Draft** | Creates the CMS item as a draft in Webflow. Review and publish manually. |
| **Published** | Creates and publishes immediately. It's live on your site. |

**When to use Draft**: You want to review formatting, add elements Ordinal doesn't support (like custom embeds), or get final approval in Webflow before going live.

**When to use Published**: You're confident in the content and want it live at the scheduled time without additional steps.

## Common Issues

**Site not appearing**: Your Webflow site needs CMS access. Free sites without CMS aren't connectable.

**Collection not syncing**: Verify your collection has the required fields and that API access is enabled in Webflow site settings.

**Field mapping errors**: Ensure field types match—text to text, rich text to rich text. Mismatched types can cause silent failures.

**Publishing failed**: Check that required Webflow fields are populated, the slug is unique, and you haven't hit CMS item limits.

**Slug already exists**: Each post needs a unique slug. If you're republishing or have a naming conflict, change the slug in the CMS Fields tab.

## Use Cases

- **Synchronized launches**: Draft a blog post, schedule social promotion, publish everything together at the same time
- **Content repurposing**: Expand Twitter threads or LinkedIn posts into full articles
- **Team workflow**: Use Ordinal's approval flow for blog content before it goes live
- **Consistent scheduling**: Manage your blog calendar alongside social content in one place
