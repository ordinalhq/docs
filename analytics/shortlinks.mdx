Shortlinks let you track clicks on the links you share in your posts. Instead of posting a long URL, you can shorten it with one click—and Ordinal will automatically track how many people clicked, where they came from, and what devices they used.

## Creating shortlinks

Shortlinks are created right inside the post editor—no need to leave your draft or visit a separate page. They work out of the box with Ordinal's default domain (`ordnl.link`).

**To shorten a link:**

1. Add a link to your post (paste a URL or use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to insert one)
2. Click on the link in the editor
3. In the popover that appears, toggle **Shorten Link?** on
4. The URL is replaced with a tracked shortlink automatically

The shortened link will look something like `ordnl.link/abc123`. When your post publishes, every click on that link is tracked.

<Tip>
  You can toggle shortening off to revert back to the original URL. The shortened link remains in your analytics history.

### Custom domains

By default, shortlinks use `ordnl.link`. If you'd prefer a branded domain like `go.yourcompany.com`, you can connect your Dub account.

## Click analytics

Once your post publishes and people start clicking, you can view detailed analytics in the **Analytics** section of Ordinal. Click data appears under the **Click Data** tab.

<Tip>
  Click analytics only track links that were shortened using Ordinal's link shortener. Regular links in your posts aren't tracked.
