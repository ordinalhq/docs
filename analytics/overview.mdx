Understand what's working and what isn't. Ordinal's analytics help you track post performance, identify top content, and see which formats resonate with your audience—all in one place.

## The Analytics Dashboard

When you open **Analytics** from the sidebar, you'll see the [**Accounts Overview**](https://app.tryordinal.com/analytics)—a bird's-eye view of all your connected accounts. This shows summary stats for each account across LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, letting you quickly compare performance and identify which profiles are driving the most engagement.

Click **See More** on any platform to dive into detailed, post-level analytics.

You can also switch to **Clicks Overview** to track click performance for links shortened with Ordinal's link shortener. For the full guide on shortlink analytics, see [Shortlinks](/analytics/shortlinks).

## Platform Analytics

Each supported platform has its own dedicated analytics page with detailed post-level data. Access these by clicking **See More** from the Accounts Overview, or navigate directly from the sidebar.

On each platform page, you'll find:

- **Post table** — Every post with its performance metrics, sortable by any column
- **Summary stats** — Aggregate metrics for the selected date range with comparison to the previous period
- **Filters** — Narrow down by date range, post type, labels, or campaign
- **Export** — Download your data as a CSV for external analysis or client reporting

## Filtering

Filters help you slice your analytics to answer specific questions. All platform analytics pages support:

| Filter         | What it does                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Date range** | Focus on a specific time period (presets like "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", or custom ranges) |
| **Post type**  | Filter by content format—Text, Image, Video, Carousel, Reel, etc.                              |
| **Labels**     | See how your custom labels perform (e.g., "Product updates" vs. "Industry news")               |
| **Campaign**   | View only posts from a specific campaign                                                       |

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Use **Labels** to tag content by topic, theme, or goal. Then filter analytics by label to see which content buckets perform best—this is one of the most powerful ways to refine your content strategy over time.
</Tip>

## Exporting Data

Every platform analytics page includes an **Export** button that downloads your current view as a CSV file. The export respects your active filters and date range, so you can create focused reports for clients or stakeholders.

## Plan Limitations

| Plan              | Analytics history |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Starter**       | Last 14 days      |
| **Pro and above** | All time          |

If you're on a Starter plan and need historical data, upgrade to Pro for unlimited analytics history.

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is one of the most comprehensive analytics integrations in Ordinal. Notably, Ordinal supports analytics for both **personal profiles** and **company pages**—a distinction that matters because LinkedIn's API rarely exposes personal profile analytics to third-party tools.

<Note>
  **Personal profile analytics** are available in Ordinal. Analytics data refreshes automatically each day, so you'll always see up-to-date performance metrics.
