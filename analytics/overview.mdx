Understand what's working and what isn't. Ordinal's analytics help you track post performance, identify top content, and see which formats resonate with your audience - all in one place.

## Analytics Overview

When you open **Analytics** from the sidebar, you land on the Analytics Overview page - a rollup view of performance across all your connected accounts. This is where you can see aggregate metrics like total impressions, engagement, and reach for each platform across your entire workspace.

For example, if you have three LinkedIn accounts connected, you'll see combined totals (total impressions across all LinkedIn accounts) plus a summary card for each individual account.

Click on any account card or **See More** to dive into that account's detailed analytics.

You can also switch to **Clicks Overview** to track click performance for links shortened with Ordinal's link shortener. See [Shortlinks](/analytics/shortlinks) for the full guide.

## Account-Level Analytics

Click into any account from the Overview to see detailed analytics for that specific profile. Each account page includes:

- **Summary stats** - Aggregate metrics for the selected date range with comparison to the previous period
- **Charts and graphs** - Visual trends showing performance over time
- **Post table** - Every post with its performance metrics, sortable by any column
- **Filters** - Narrow down by date range, post type, labels, or campaign
- **Export** - Download your data as a CSV for external analysis or client reporting
- **Earned Media Value** - See the dollar value of your organic reach based on configurable CPM

## Earned Media Value (EMV)

Earned Media Value helps you understand the monetary value of your organic social reach. EMV calculates what you would have paid in advertising to achieve the same number of impressions.

### How it works

EMV is calculated using this formula:

```
EMV = (Impressions / 1,000) × CPM
```

Where **CPM** (Cost Per Mille) is the amount you'd pay for 1,000 ad impressions on that platform.

### Configuring CPM

Each platform has its own CPM setting that you can customize based on your industry benchmarks or actual ad costs:

1. Go to any account's analytics page
2. Click the **Earned Media Value** tab
3. Adjust the **CPM** input to match your target rate

CPM values are saved per channel on the workspace-level. That means if you change the CPM for one LinkedIn account, it'll change the calculation for all other LinkedIn accounts in the workspace.

Default values:

| Platform  | Default CPM |
| --------- | ----------- |
| LinkedIn  | \$30        |
| Twitter   | \$10        |
| Instagram | \$10        |
| Facebook  | \$10        |

<Tip>
  Use your actual advertising CPM rates for the most accurate EMV calculations. If you're not running ads, industry benchmarks are a good starting point - LinkedIn typically has higher CPMs than other platforms due to its B2B audience.
</Tip>

### Viewing EMV

EMV appears in two places:

- **EMV tab** - A bar chart showing EMV by post, with total EMV for the selected date range
- **EMV column** - In the post table, showing individual post EMV values (sortable)

EMV is also included when you export analytics to CSV.

## Filtering

Filters help you slice your analytics to answer specific questions. All account analytics pages support:

| Filter         | What it does                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Date range** | Focus on a specific time period (presets like "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", or custom ranges) |
| **Post type**  | Filter by content format - Text, Image, Video, Carousel, Reel, etc.                            |
| **Labels**     | See how your custom labels perform (e.g., "Product updates" vs. "Industry news")               |
| **Campaign**   | View only posts from a specific campaign                                                       |

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Use **Labels** to tag content by topic, theme, or goal. Then filter analytics by label to see which content buckets perform best - this is one of the most powerful ways to refine your content strategy over time.
</Tip>

## Exporting Data

Every account analytics page includes an **Export** button that downloads your current view as a CSV file. The export respects your active filters and date range, so you can create focused reports for clients or stakeholders.

## Plan Limitations

| Plan              | Analytics history |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Starter**       | Last 14 days      |
| **Pro and above** | All time          |

If you're on a Starter plan and need historical data, upgrade to Pro for unlimited analytics history.
