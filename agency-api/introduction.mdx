<Warning>
  **Looking for the Workspace API?**
  
  This is the **Agency API** for managing multiple workspaces at the company level. If you want to create posts, manage profiles, or access workspace-specific resources, see the [Workspace API](/api/introduction) instead.
</Warning>

## Overview

The Ordinal Agency API allows agencies and teams to programmatically manage multiple workspaces from a single company account. With company-level API access, you can create new workspaces, manage workspace API keys, and automate your multi-client workflows.

## Use Cases

The Agency API is designed for:

- **Agencies** managing social media for multiple clients, each with their own workspace
- **Enterprises** with multiple brands or business units
- **Platforms** building integrations that provision Ordinal workspaces for their users

## Quick Start

<Info>
  **Enterprise Plan Required**
  
  The Agency API requires an Enterprise plan. [Contact sales](mailto:sales@tryordinal.com) to upgrade your account.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Company API Key">
    Navigate to your company settings and create a new company API key. See the [Authentication](/agency-api/authentication) guide for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Your First Request">
    Use the company API key as a Bearer token to authenticate your requests:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1/company/workspaces" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ord_c_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    ```

    Confirm that you see your workspaces in the response.

    ```json
    {
      "workspaces": [
        {
          "id": "workspace-uuid-1",
          "name": "Client A",
          "slug": "client-a",
          "timezone": "America/New_York",
          "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        {
          "id": "workspace-uuid-2",
          "name": "Client B",
          "slug": "client-b",
          "timezone": "Europe/London",
          "createdAt": "2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Agency API vs Workspace API

| Feature | Agency API | Workspace API |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| **Scope** | All workspaces in your company | Single workspace |
| **Key prefix** | `ord_c_*` | `ord_*` |
| **Create workspaces** | Yes | No |
| **Manage workspace API keys** | Yes | No |
| **Access posts and profiles** | No (use workspace keys) | Yes |

<Tip>
  Use the Agency API to create workspaces and generate workspace API keys. Then use those workspace API keys with the [Workspace API](/api/introduction) to manage posts, profiles, and other workspace-specific resources.
</Tip>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage. The Agency API has a limit of 100 requests per minute per API key.

```json
{
  "code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "message": "Rate limit of 100 requests per 60s exceeded. Quota resets in 45 seconds"
}
```

If you need a higher rate limit, please reach out to support.
