Campaigns group related posts around a theme, launch, event, or marketing initiative. They provide a unified view of all content in an initiative, help teams stay aligned, and let you track performance across posts.

## What campaigns are for

- **Product launches** - Coordinate announcements across all platforms with unified timing
- **Events** - Build momentum before, during, and after conferences, webinars, or launches
- **Content series** - Organize multi-part educational or storytelling content
- **Seasonal promotions** - Plan holiday and seasonal marketing pushes

Campaigns add structure without constraining how you work. A post can exist without a campaign, and campaigns can have any number of posts.

## Creating a campaign

You can create campaigns in multiple ways:

- **Keyboard Shortcut**  -  Enter the keyboard shortcut `C` from the Calendar view.
- **Calendar**  -  Click the **\+** button in the top-righthand corner and select "Create Campaign"

Enter a name and date range, then click Create. You can add posts immediately or build out your campaign brief first.

## The campaign page

Open a campaign to see its dedicated workspace:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    The main view for planning and organizing:

    - **Campaign brief**  -  A text editor for overview, key messaging, goals/KPIs, target audience, and notes.
    - **Attachments**  -  Upload assets, brand guidelines, or reference materials directly to the campaign.
    - **Post list**  -  All posts and ideas in the campaign with status indicators.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Calendar">
    A focused calendar view showing only this campaign's posts. Useful for visualizing timing and spotting gaps in your schedule.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sidebar">
    Quick access to campaign settings:

    - **Dates**  -  Adjust start and end dates
    - **Labels**  -  Categorize by product, team, or goal
    - **Approvals**  -  Request sign-off from stakeholders
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Adding posts

Select a campaign from the **Campaign** dropdown in any post's sidebar - works for new posts, existing posts, and even ideas. To remove a post from a campaign, just clear the selection. The post remains in your workspace, just unlinked.

## Collaboration

### Approvals

Request approval on an entire campaign before executing. Approvers can review the brief, attached assets, and planned posts before signing off.

### Comments & Activity

Every campaign has a threaded comment section and activity feed at the bottom of the page. Use comments to discuss strategy, leave feedback, or tag teammates with @mentions. The activity feed tracks all changes - posts added, dates changed, approvals granted.

## Sharing externally

Share a campaign with clients or stakeholders who don't have Ordinal accounts:

1. Click the **Share** icon on the campaign page
2. Toggle **Share public access** on
3. Copy the link

External viewers can see the campaign brief and optionally the posts within it (toggle **Share posts** separately). They cannot edit anything.

<Note>
  Anyone with the link can view. Disable sharing when no longer needed.
</Note>

## Analytics

Campaigns don't have a separate analytics page. Instead, filter by campaign in the main **Analytics** section to see aggregate performance across all posts in the campaign.

## Deleting campaigns

Delete a campaign from the campaign header menu. You'll choose what happens to the posts:

- **Keep posts**  -  Posts remain in your workspace, just unlinked from the campaign
- **Delete posts**  -  Posts are permanently removed along with the campaign

<Warning>
  Deleting is permanent. Consider keeping posts if they contain valuable published content.
</Warning>
