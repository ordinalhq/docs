Campaigns group related posts around a theme, launch, event, or marketing initiative. They provide a unified view of all content in an initiative, aggregate analytics across posts, and help teams stay aligned.

## What campaigns are for

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Product Launches" icon="rocket">
    Coordinate announcements across all platforms with unified timing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Events" icon="calendar-star">
    Build momentum before, during, and after events.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Series" icon="layer-group">
    Organize multi-part educational or storytelling content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Seasonal Campaigns" icon="snowflake">
    Plan holiday and seasonal promotions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Campaigns add structure without constraining how you work. A post can exist without a campaign, and campaigns can have any number of posts.

## Campaign properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Clear identifier—"Q1 Launch", "Summer Sale 2024" |
| **Description** | Optional context for team alignment |
| **Date range** | Start and end dates for the initiative |
| **Labels** | Categorize by product, team, or goal |

<Tip>
Date ranges help with calendar visualization and reporting but don't restrict when you can add posts.
</Tip>

## Adding posts to campaigns

### During post creation

Select a campaign from the Campaign dropdown in the post composer. The post is associated immediately.

### For existing posts

1. Open the post
2. Find the Campaign field in the sidebar
3. Select a campaign
4. Save

### Removing posts

To remove a post from a campaign, open the post, click the campaign name, and clear the selection. The post remains—it's just no longer associated.

## The campaign view

Open a campaign to see its dedicated dashboard:

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Timeline** | All posts distributed across the campaign period |
| **Post list** | Every post with status indicators |
| **Status summary** | Counts by status (draft, scheduled, posted) |
| **Performance** | Aggregate analytics once posts publish |

## Campaign analytics

Campaigns aggregate metrics across all posts:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total reach** | Combined audience across all posts and platforms |
| **Engagement** | Aggregate likes, comments, shares |
| **Posts** | Count by status |
| **Top performers** | Best-performing posts in the campaign |

<Check>
Analytics update as posts publish and collect engagement. Use campaign-level metrics to evaluate initiative success beyond individual posts.

## Archiving and deleting

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Archive">
    Archive completed campaigns to keep them for reference:
    - Don't appear in the default campaigns view
    - Can be found via filters or search
    - Retain all posts and analytics
    
    <Tip>
    Archiving is non-destructive—perfect for completed initiatives you want to reference later.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Delete">
    Deleting a campaign removes it permanently. Choose what happens to posts:
    - **Keep posts** — Posts remain, just unlinked
    - **Delete posts** — Posts are deleted with the campaign
    
    <Warning>
    Deleting campaigns with published posts affects your analytics history. Consider archiving instead.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't delete campaign">
