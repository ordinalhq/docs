## Core Concepts

### Social Profiles

A social profile is a connected account from any supported platform (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). You can connect multiple profiles and manage them all from Ordinal.

### Posts

Posts are the content you create and publish to your social profiles. A single post can be published to multiple profiles simultaneously.

### Campaigns

Campaigns are collections of related posts organized around a theme, product launch, or marketing initiative. They help you plan and track coordinated content efforts.

### Labels

Labels are tags you can apply to posts for organization and filtering. Use them to categorize content by topic, campaign, or any other criteria.

### Statuses

Statuses track where a post is in your workflow:
- **Draft** - Work in progress
- **Pending Approval** - Awaiting review
- **Scheduled** - Approved and queued for publishing
- **Published** - Live on your social profiles

### Approvals

The approval workflow lets team members review and approve posts before they're published. This ensures quality and brand consistency.

## Platform-Specific Features

Different platforms have unique features and requirements. Ordinal handles these automatically while giving you platform-specific controls when needed.
