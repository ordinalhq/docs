## Core Concepts

Understanding these key concepts will help you get the most out of Ordinal.

### Social Profiles

A social profile is a connected account from any supported platform (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). You can connect multiple profiles and manage them all from Ordinal.

<Tip>
Connect all your social accounts to manage everything from one place. Each profile appears in your sidebar for quick access.

### Posts

Posts are the content you create and publish to your social profiles. A single post can be published to multiple profiles simultaneously, with automatic adaptation to each platform's requirements.

### Campaigns

Campaigns are collections of related posts organized around a theme, product launch, or marketing initiative. They help you:
- Plan coordinated content efforts
- Track aggregate performance
- Keep related posts organized

### Labels

Labels are tags you can apply to posts for organization and filtering. Use them to categorize content by:
- Topic (industry news, product updates, tips)
- Content type (educational, promotional)
- Priority (urgent, evergreen)

### Statuses

Statuses track where a post is in your workflow:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress |
| **Pending Approval** | Awaiting review |
| **Scheduled** | Approved and queued for publishing |
| **Published** | Live on your social profiles |
| **Failed** | Publishing failed (requires attention) |

### Approvals

The approval workflow lets team members review and approve posts before they're published. This ensures quality and brand consistency across all your content.

With approvals enabled, no content goes live without review—giving you confidence in everything you publish.

## The Content Workflow

A typical post flows through Ordinal like this:

1. **Create** - Draft your content in the composer
2. **Review** - Submit for approval (if enabled)
3. **Schedule** - Set when to publish
4. **Publish** - Content goes live automatically
5. **Analyze** - Track performance in analytics

## Platform-Specific Features

Different platforms have unique features and requirements. Ordinal handles these automatically while giving you platform-specific controls when needed.

For example:
- **Twitter** - Thread composer with character counts
- **Instagram** - Carousel builder with visual preview
- **LinkedIn** - Document post support
- **TikTok** - Video scheduling
