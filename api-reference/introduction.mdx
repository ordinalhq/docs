## Overview

The Ordinal API allows you to programmatically manage your social media content, posts, profiles, and workspace. Use the API to integrate Ordinal into your existing workflows and automate content creation and scheduling.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://app.tryordinal.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting your API key

1. Log in to your Ordinal workspace
2. Navigate to Settings → Integrations → API
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy and securely store your API key

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Rate limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure service stability. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Error handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid input parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or revoked API key |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource does not exist |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

### Error response format

```json
{
  "code": "BAD_REQUEST",
  "message": "Bad Request",
  "data": {
    "errors": {
      "id": ["Invalid UUID"],
      "email": ["Invalid email address"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Supported channels

The API supports the following social media channels:

- LinkedIn

## Workspace context
