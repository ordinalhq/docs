## Notes

Every post has a **Notes** section in the sidebar for internal context that doesn't appear in the published content. Use it for:

- Creative briefs and guidelines
- Links to reference materials or assets
- Internal instructions for your team

Click **View Notes** in the sidebar to open the full rich text editor. Notes support formatting, links, and task lists.

## Subscribers

Subscribers receive notifications about a post's activity—comments, status changes, approvals, and more.

**You're automatically subscribed when you:**

- Create the post
- Comment on it
- Are @mentioned
- Are assigned as an approver

**To manually subscribe or unsubscribe:** Click the **Subscribe** or **Unsubscribe** button in the sidebar. You can also add other team members by clicking the subscriber avatars and selecting from your workspace.

<Tip>
  Configure which notifications you receive and how (email, Slack, in-app) in [Notification Settings](/collaboration/notifications).
</Tip>

## Activity

At the bottom of every post, you'll find the **Activity** section—a chronological timeline showing everything that's happened:

- Status changes
- Comments added
- Approvals requested and completed
- Edits and updates

This gives you a complete history of the post from creation to publication.

## Public sharing

Need to share a post with someone outside your workspace? You can make any post publicly viewable.

1. Click the **link icon** in the post header
2. Toggle **Share public access** on
3. Copy the link and share it

Anyone with the link can view the post (read-only)—no login required. Toggle the setting off to revoke access.

## Duplicating posts

**Duplicate** creates a single copy of a post, including its content, media, labels, and settings. Find it in the duplicate menu (icon in the header).

**Batch Duplicate** creates a recurring series of posts—useful for recurring content like weekly newsletters or monthly updates:

1. Click the duplicate icon → **Batch Duplicate**
2. Set a **start date** for the first duplicate
3. Choose the **frequency** (every X days, weeks, or months)
4. Select how many **occurrences** to create (up to 10)

All duplicates inherit the original's content and settings. You can edit each one individually after creation.

## Deleting posts

To delete a post, click the **...** menu in the header and select **Delete**. You'll be asked to confirm—this action cannot be undone.

<Warning>
  Deleting a scheduled post will prevent it from publishing. If the post has already published, deleting it from Ordinal does not remove it from the social platform.
</Warning>
