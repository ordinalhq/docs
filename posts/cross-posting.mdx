Cross-posting lets you create content once and distribute it across multiple social platforms from a single post. Unlike many scheduling tools, Ordinal gives you full flexibility—customize your copy and assets independently for each platform so you can optimize content for every audience.

## Creating a cross-post

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select platforms">
    Create a new post and click the **Cross-Post** button to add platforms. Select as many as you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your content">
    Start writing in any platform tab. By default, content syncs across all platforms automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize per platform">
    Click each platform tab to tailor that version. Change the copy, adjust hashtags, swap out media—each platform is fully independent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select accounts">
    Choose which connected account to use for each platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule">
    Set one time—all versions publish together.

    <Check>
      Your cross-post appears as a single item on the calendar with multiple platform icons.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Start with your longest-form platform (usually LinkedIn), then customize shorter versions. Writing long and trimming is easier than writing short and expanding.
</Tip>

## Platform tabs

Each platform in your cross-post has its own tab at the top of the editor. Click a tab to:

- See the live preview for that platform
- Edit copy specific to that platform
- Add, remove, or reorder media for that platform
- View the character count and limits

Changes you make in one tab only affect that platform—unless content is synced.

## Customizing per channel

Ordinal lets you customize **both copy and assets** independently for each platform:

| What you can customize | Examples                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Copy**               | Different hooks, hashtag strategies, character lengths               |
| **Assets**             | Platform-optimized images, different aspect ratios, video vs. static |
| **Mentions**           | Tag platform-specific accounts                                       |
| **Links**              | Include or exclude based on platform support                         |

When you edit a platform's content, it diverges from the others. The sync indicator updates to show that platform has custom content.

## Syncing content

By default, content syncs across all platforms—edit one and the others update automatically. But once you customize a platform, it diverges.

### How to re-sync

If you want to copy content from one platform to others:

1. Click the **Sync** button in the cross-post bar
2. Choose your **source channel** (the one you want to copy from)
3. Select which **destination channels** to update
4. Choose what to sync:
   - **Copy** — syncs text content
   - **Assets** — syncs images and videos

<Note>
  Syncing overwrites existing content on the destination channels. Some assets may not sync if they're not supported by the destination platform (e.g., PDFs only work on LinkedIn).
</Note>

You can sync copy to some channels and assets to others—they're independent options.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match platform culture">
    LinkedIn audiences expect professional depth; Twitter rewards brevity and punch; Instagram focuses on visual impact. Customize accordingly rather than posting identical content everywhere.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use native features">
    Hashtag strategies differ by platform:

    - **LinkedIn:** 3-5 targeted professional hashtags
    - **Instagram:** 5-10 discoverable hashtags (or in first comment)
    - **Twitter:** 1-3 minimal, focused hashtags
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview each version">
    Always check the preview for each platform before scheduling. Rendering differences, link previews, and cropping can surprise you.
