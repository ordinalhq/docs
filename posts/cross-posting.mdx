Cross-posting lets you create content once and distribute it across multiple social platforms. Each platform version can be customized while sharing a unified schedule and campaign association.

## How cross-posting works

When you select multiple platforms in the channel selector, Ordinal creates linked versions of your post for each platform. By default, content syncs across all versions—edit one and the others update automatically.

<Note>
Content adapts automatically to each platform's character limits and formatting capabilities. The editor shows real-time counts for each platform.
</Note>

| Platform | Character Limit | Media Support |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Twitter/X | 280 (25K with Premium) | 4 images, video, GIF |
| LinkedIn | 3,000 | Images, video, documents |
| Facebook | 63,206 | Images, video, links |
| Instagram | 2,200 | Images, video, carousels |
| Threads | 500 | Images, video |
| TikTok | 2,200 | Video only |

## Creating a cross-post

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select platforms">
    Create a new post and click multiple platforms in the channel selector. Each shows its requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write content">
    Content syncs to all platforms by default. The editor shows character counts for each.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize per platform">
    Click each platform tab to preview and optionally customize that version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select accounts">
    Choose which connected account to use for each platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule">
    Set one time—all versions publish together.
    
    <Check>
    Your cross-post appears as a single item on the calendar with multiple platform icons.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start with your longest-form platform (usually LinkedIn), then customize shorter versions. Writing long and trimming is easier than writing short and expanding.
</Tip>

## Content synchronization

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Synced mode">
    When content is synced (the default):
    - Edit text and it updates everywhere
    - Add media and it appears on all platforms
    - Formatting adjusts automatically per platform
    
    A "Synced" indicator shows when content is linked across platforms.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom content">
    To tailor content for a specific platform:
    
    1. Click the platform tab in the composer
    2. Make your changes—text, hashtags, media
    3. The content diverges from other platforms
    4. The sync indicator updates to show "Custom"
    
    Customizations are platform-specific and don't affect other versions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Re-syncing">
    To copy content from one platform to others:
    
    1. Click the **Sync** button
    2. Choose the source platform
    3. Select which platforms to update
    4. Content copies over, replacing any customizations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Media across platforms

Media syncs by default but can be customized per platform. Key considerations:

| Consideration | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Aspect ratios** | Instagram favors 1:1 or 4:5; Twitter favors 16:9 |
| **Carousels** | Different max images per platform |
| **PDFs** | LinkedIn only |
| **Video length** | Varies significantly by platform |

Ordinal warns you when media won't work on a particular platform. Customize or remove media for that version as needed.

## Scheduling and publishing

Cross-posts share scheduling:
- Single scheduled time for all platforms
- Same campaign and labels
- Unified view on the calendar

Publishing happens independently:
- Each platform publishes separately
- Success or failure tracked per-channel
- One failure doesn't affect other platforms

<Check>
If one platform fails, the others still publish. Retry the failed platform individually from the post detail view.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match platform culture">
    LinkedIn audiences expect professional depth; Twitter rewards brevity and punch; Instagram focuses on visual impact. Customize accordingly rather than posting identical content everywhere.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use native features">
    Hashtag strategies differ by platform:
    - **LinkedIn:** 3-5 targeted professional hashtags
    - **Instagram:** 5-10 discoverable hashtags (or in first comment)
    - **Twitter:** 1-3 minimal, focused hashtags
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stagger when appropriate">
    You can publish all platforms simultaneously, but staggering by 15-30 minutes can catch different audience segments and appear more organic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview each version">
    Always check the preview for each platform before scheduling. Rendering differences, link previews, and cropping can surprise you.
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content not syncing between platforms">
    Check if sync was manually broken by customizing. Click the Sync button to re-sync from your preferred source platform.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One platform failed while others succeeded">
    Open the post detail view to see per-platform status. Check the error message for the failed platform and retry after fixing the issue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Media appearing differently across platforms">
    Each platform crops and displays media differently. Use platform-recommended dimensions or customize media per platform for best results.
  </Accordion>
