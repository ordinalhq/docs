Cross-posting lets you share the same content across multiple social platforms simultaneously while tailoring it for each audience.

## Platform Adaptations

Ordinal automatically handles platform differences:

| Platform | Character Limit | Media Support |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Twitter/X | 280 (25K Premium) | 4 images, video, GIF |
| LinkedIn | 3,000 | Images, video, documents |
| Facebook | 63,206 | Images, video, links |
| Instagram | 2,200 | Images, video, carousels |
| Threads | 500 | Images, video |

## Customization Options

### Per-Platform Text

Customize your message for each platform:
- Adjust length and tone
- Use platform-specific hashtags
- Include or exclude mentions

### Per-Platform Media

Use different media for different platforms:
- Optimal image sizes
- Platform-specific video formats
- Alternative media options

<Tip>
Instagram performs best with square (1:1) or portrait (4:5) images, while Twitter favors landscape (16:9) images.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customize, don't duplicate">
    Take time to tailor content for each platform's audience and norms. LinkedIn audiences expect professional tone; Twitter favors concise, punchy content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stagger posting times">
    Avoid posting to all platforms at exactly the same time. Stagger by 15-30 minutes to catch different audience segments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Platform-native content">
    Some content works better as platform-native rather than cross-posted. Video formats especially may need platform-specific versions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content truncated on platform">
    Your text exceeded that platform's character limit. Edit the platform-specific version to fit within limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Image appears cropped differently">
    Each platform crops images differently. Use the preview to adjust cropping, or upload platform-specific image versions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Some platforms failed while others succeeded">
    Check individual platform status in the Posts list. Re-try failed posts after fixing any authorization or content issues.
  </Accordion>
