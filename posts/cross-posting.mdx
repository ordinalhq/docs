## Overview

Cross-posting lets you share the same content across multiple social platforms simultaneously while tailoring it for each audience.

## How Cross-Posting Works

When you create a post and select multiple profiles:

1. **Write once** - Create your core content
2. **Adapt automatically** - Content adjusts to platform limits
3. **Customize per platform** - Fine-tune for each audience
4. **Publish together** - Schedule all versions at once

## Platform Adaptations

Ordinal automatically handles platform differences:

| Platform | Character Limit | Media Support |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Twitter/X | 280 (25K Premium) | 4 images, video, GIF |
| LinkedIn | 3,000 | Images, video, documents |
| Facebook | 63,206 | Images, video, links |
| Instagram | 2,200 | Images, video, carousels |
| Threads | 500 | Images, video |

## Customization Options

### Per-Platform Text

Customize your message for each platform:
- Adjust length and tone
- Use platform-specific hashtags
- Include or exclude mentions

### Per-Platform Media

Use different media for different platforms:
- Optimal image sizes
- Platform-specific video formats
- Alternative media options
