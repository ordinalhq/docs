## Overview

Marketing Boost Channels coordinate your team to amplify content reach. When you publish a post, your team gets notified to engage, share, and help boost visibility.

## How It Works

1. **Create a boost channel** - Group team members together
2. **Publish content** - Post goes live on your social profiles
3. **Team notification** - Members receive alerts to engage
4. **Coordinated action** - Team likes, comments, and shares
5. **Amplified reach** - Your content reaches more people

## Setting Up a Boost Channel

1. Go to **Marketing Boost Channels** → **New Channel**
2. Name your channel
3. Add team members
4. Configure notification preferences
5. Set engagement guidelines
