- On the Calendar
- In Campaign views

<Tip>
Use label filters to focus on specific content types—great for reviewing all promotional posts before a sale.

### Reporting

Track performance by label:
- See aggregate metrics per label
- Compare label performance
- Identify top-performing categories

## Managing Labels

### Edit Labels

Update label names, colors, or descriptions at any time. Changes apply to all labeled posts.

### Delete Labels

Remove labels you no longer need. Posts will be un-labeled but not deleted.

<Warning>
Deleting a label removes it from all posts. Consider renaming instead if you want to preserve the categorization.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Label not appearing on post">
    Ensure you saved the post after applying labels. Labels are saved with the post, not immediately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find labeled posts">
    Check your filters. Multiple filters are combined with AND logic—a post must match all filters to appear.
  </Accordion>
