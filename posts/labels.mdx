Labels are colored tags that help you organize posts and campaigns. Apply labels to categorize by content type, topic, priority, or any taxonomy that fits your workflow. Labels appear throughout Ordinal and enable powerful filtering.

## Creating labels

      <Step title="Open label settings">

        Click **Add Label** and enter a name.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Choose colors">
        Select text and background colors for visual distinction.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Save">
        Click **Create** to add the label.
        
        <Check>

        </Check>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="While editing">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open label field">
        In any post, click the Labels field in the sidebar.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Type a new name">
        Start typing a label that doesn't exist yet.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create inline">
        Click **Create "[label name]"** to create and apply it immediately.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Use consistent color coding—green for approved, yellow for pending, red for urgent. Visual patterns help your team scan the calendar quickly.
</Tip>

## Applying labels

### To posts

Open any post and find the Labels field in the sidebar. Search existing labels or create new ones. Apply multiple labels to a single post—there's no limit.

### To campaigns

Campaigns can also have labels, helping you categorize entire initiatives. Open a campaign and add labels the same way.

### Bulk labeling

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select posts">
    In the list view, check multiple posts using the checkboxes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add labels">
    Click **Add Labels** in the bulk actions bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose labels">
    Select which labels to apply to all selected posts.
    
    <Check>
    All selected posts now display the applied labels.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filtering by label

Labels enable filtering throughout Ordinal:

| View | How it helps |
|------|--------------|
| **Calendar** | Focus on specific content types or campaigns |
| **Posts list** | Narrow down to matching posts |
| **Analytics** | Compare performance by category |

<Note>
Filters use AND logic—selecting multiple labels shows only posts with all selected labels.
</Note>

## Label use cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content type">
    Categorize by format:
    - 📸 Photo
    - 🎥 Video
    - 📄 Article
    - 📊 Poll
    - 🧵 Thread
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Topic or pillar">

</AccordionGroup>

## Labels vs campaigns

Both help organize content, but they serve different purposes:

| Aspect | Labels | Campaigns |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Flexible categorization | Time-bound groupings |
| **Date range** | No | Yes |
| **Multiple per post** | Yes | One per post |
| **Analytics** | Filter by label | Aggregate campaign metrics |

<Tip>
Use campaigns for initiatives with start/end dates (launches, promotions). Use labels for ongoing categorization that spans campaigns (content type, topic).
</Tip>

## Managing labels

### Edit labels

Update a label's name or colors in **Settings → Labels**. Changes apply immediately to all posts using that label.

### Delete labels

Remove labels you no longer need. Deleting removes the label from all posts but doesn't delete the posts themselves.

<Warning>
Deleting a label is permanent. Consider renaming instead if you want to preserve the categorization.
</Warning>

### Label usage

In Settings → Labels, see how many posts and campaigns use each label. This helps identify unused labels to clean up.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Label not appearing on post">
    Ensure you saved the post after applying the label. Try refreshing the page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find labeled posts">
    Check your current filters. Multiple filters combine with AND logic—a post must match all selected filters to appear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Labels not syncing across team">
    Labels are workspace-level. Verify everyone is in the same workspace. Changes should appear for all team members.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
