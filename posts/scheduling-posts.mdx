Scheduling determines when your content goes live. Set a specific date and time, and Ordinal handles publishing automatically—posts go out within seconds of their scheduled time.

## Scheduling a post

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open or create a post">
    Create a new post or open an existing draft from your Posts list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Schedule">
    Click the **Schedule** button in the composer toolbar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select date and time">
    Choose your preferred date and time from the picker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm timezone">
    Verify the timezone is correct. Ordinal uses your workspace timezone.
    
    <Check>
    Your post moves to "Scheduled" status and appears on the calendar.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The calendar provides visual scheduling—click or drag on any time slot to create a post with that time pre-filled.
</Tip>

## Publishing options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Schedule for later">
    Choose a specific future date and time. The post:
    - Moves to "Scheduled" status
    - Appears on the calendar
    - Publishes automatically when the time arrives
    - Can still be edited until publishing begins
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Post now">
    Publish immediately without scheduling. The post bypasses the calendar and goes live within seconds. Useful for timely content or when you've finished drafting and want it out right away.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Queue">
    If your workspace has queue slots configured, add posts to the queue instead of picking specific times. Posts publish in order using your preset time slots.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Timezone handling

<Warning>
All times display in your workspace timezone, configured in **Settings → General**. Verify this is set correctly to avoid scheduling mishaps.
</Warning>

All team members see the same times regardless of their local timezone. When scheduling, the picker shows times in your workspace timezone with a clear indicator.

## Managing scheduled posts

### Viewing your schedule

Find scheduled posts in multiple places:
- **Calendar** — Visual timeline showing all scheduled content
- **Posts list** — Filter by "Scheduled" status
- **Profile view** — See the schedule for a specific social profile

### Rescheduling

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the post">
    Find the post on your calendar or in the Posts list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change the time">
    Click the current scheduled time and select a new date/time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Confirm your changes.
    
    <Check>
    The calendar updates immediately with the new schedule.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Alternatively, drag posts directly on the calendar to reschedule them visually.

### Unscheduling

To return a scheduled post to draft:

1. Open the post
2. Click **Unschedule** or remove the scheduled time
3. The post returns to "Draft" status

<Note>
You cannot unschedule a post that's currently publishing or already published.
</Note>

## Bulk scheduling

Schedule multiple posts at once:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select posts">
    In the Posts list, check multiple drafts using the checkboxes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Schedule Selected">
    The bulk scheduling dialog opens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your method">
    - **Stagger** — Automatic spacing (e.g., 2 hours apart)
    - **Specific times** — Set each post's time individually
    - **Add to queue** — Use your preset time slots
    
    <Check>
    All selected posts appear on your calendar with their scheduled times.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cross-post scheduling

When a post targets multiple platforms, all channels share the same scheduled time but publish independently:

- One channel can succeed while another fails
- Each channel has its own status tracking
- Retry failed channels without affecting successful ones

View per-channel status in the post detail view.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Post published at wrong time">
    Check your workspace timezone in **Settings → General**. All scheduling uses this timezone, not your local browser time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Post failed to publish">
    Check the Posts list for error details. Common causes:
    - Expired account authorization (reconnect in Settings)
    - Platform outage (retry later)
    - Content policy violation (review and edit)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find my scheduled post">
    Check calendar filters. The post may be filtered out by platform, status, or label filters.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
