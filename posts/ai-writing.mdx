| **Adapt for platforms** | Adjust content for different audiences |

## Accessing AI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Slash command">
    Type `/ai` in the editor to open the AI assistant. This is the fastest method when you're already typing.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="AI button">
    Click the AI button (✨) in the editor toolbar to open the assistant panel.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Selection">
    Select text in the editor, then click the AI button to improve just that selection.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Generating content

Create a new post from a prompt:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI assistant">
    Type `/ai` or click the AI button in a new or existing post.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe what you want">
    Write a prompt describing your desired content:
    
    ```
    Write a LinkedIn post about the importance of work-life balance 
    for remote teams. Professional but warm tone. Include a 
    call-to-action to share experiences.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate">
    Click Generate and wait for the output (usually a few seconds).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and refine">
    Read the generated content. Edit directly, regenerate for a different take, or use AI again to refine specific parts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert">
    Add the content to your post editor. Continue editing as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Include your target platform in the prompt. AI will respect character limits and adjust tone accordingly: "Write a Twitter thread about..." vs "Write a LinkedIn article about..."
</Tip>

## Improving existing content

AI can refine text you've already written:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select text">
    Highlight the content you want to improve in the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose an action">
    Click the AI button and select:
    - **Make it shorter** — Condense without losing meaning
    - **Make it longer** — Expand with more detail
    - **Change tone** — More professional, casual, or engaging
    - **Fix grammar** — Correct errors
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review changes">
    AI shows your original text alongside the improved version. Accept, reject, or regenerate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generating from URLs

Turn articles, blog posts, or web pages into social content:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the URL">
    Copy the link to the content you want to repurpose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt with URL">
    In the AI assistant, reference the URL:
    
    ```
    Turn this article into a LinkedIn post that highlights 
    the key insights: https://example.com/article
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your perspective">
    AI summarizes the source—add your own take to make it authentic.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Always credit original sources when repurposing content. AI generates summaries, but attribution is your responsibility.
</Note>

## Writing effective prompts

The quality of AI output depends heavily on your prompt. Include:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Platform context">
    Specify which platform you're writing for. Each has different norms:
    
    ```
    Write a Twitter thread... (concise, punchy)
    Write a LinkedIn post... (professional, longer-form)
    Write an Instagram caption... (visual-focused, hashtag-friendly)
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tone and voice">
    Describe the tone you want:
    
    ```
    Professional but approachable
    Casual and conversational
    Authoritative and data-driven
    Inspiring and motivational
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Specific elements">
    Request specific components:
    
    ```
    Include a hook that grabs attention
    End with a question to drive comments
    Add a call-to-action
    Include 3-5 relevant hashtags
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Constraints">
    Set boundaries to focus the output:
    
    ```
    Keep it under 200 words
    Use bullet points
    No emojis
    Focus on [specific angle]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example prompts

**Product announcement:**
```
Write a LinkedIn post announcing our new AI-powered scheduling feature. 
Tone: excited but professional. Highlight the time-saving benefits for 
social media managers. End with a CTA to try it out.
```

**Thought leadership:**
```
Write a Twitter thread about why authenticity matters more than 
perfection in personal branding. 5-7 tweets. Conversational tone. 
Include specific examples.
```

**Engagement post:**
```
Write an Instagram caption asking followers about their biggest 
productivity challenges. Keep it casual and relatable. Include 
relevant hashtags at the end.
```

## Custom prompts

Save prompts you use frequently:

1. Go to **Settings → Prompts**
2. Click **Create Prompt**
3. Define your prompt template with variables
4. Save for reuse

Template example:
```
Create a {platform} post about {topic} for {audience}.
Tone: {tone}. Include: {elements}.
```

Fill in the variables each time for consistent but customized output.

## Best practices

**Review everything** — AI output is a starting point, not a final product. Read critically and edit.

**Add your voice** — The best AI-assisted posts combine AI efficiency with your authentic perspective.

**Verify facts** — AI can make mistakes or include outdated information. Check any specific claims.

**Iterate** — If the first generation isn't right, refine your prompt and try again. Prompting is a skill that improves with practice.

**Don't over-rely** — AI helps with scale and ideation, but your unique insights are what make content valuable.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Output doesn't match what I wanted">
    Be more specific in your prompt. Include platform, tone, length, and any specific elements you need. Vague prompts produce generic output.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content is too generic">
    Add unique context: your company, industry, audience, or specific angles you want to cover. Generic inputs produce generic outputs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI is slow or not responding">
    Check your internet connection. If issues persist, try refreshing the page. High-traffic periods may cause slower responses.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
