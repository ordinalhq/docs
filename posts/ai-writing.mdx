Ordinal AI is a chat-based writing assistant that helps you draft, refine, and publish social content. It has context on all your past posts, so it can match your voice and learn from what's worked before.

<Note>
Ordinal AI is in Beta. Broader access is coming soon.

## Accessing AI

Open Ordinal AI from anywhere in the app:

| Method | How |
| ------ | --- |
| Keyboard shortcut | Press `A` |
| Sidebar | Click **Ordinal AI** at the bottom of the sidebar |

The AI chat opens in a sidebar panel, ready for your request.

## What AI can do

| Capability | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Draft posts** | Generate new content based on topics, ideas, or your past posts |
| **Refine content** | Improve tone, length, or clarity of existing drafts |
| **Analyze performance** | Review how your content is performing across channels |
| **Take actions** | Schedule posts, create drafts, and more - directly from chat |

## Using AI Chat

Ordinal AI works through natural conversation. Just type what you need:

- "Draft a LinkedIn post about our product launch"
- "Make this shorter and more punchy"
- "What posts performed best last month?"
- "Schedule this for tomorrow at 9am"

When AI generates content you like, click **Create Post** to turn it into a real post in your calendar.

### Sources

Toggle additional context sources to improve AI responses:

| Source | What it provides |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| **Web search** | Real-time information from the web |
| **Company info** | Your company details and context |
| **Style guidelines** | Your brand voice and writing standards |
| **Profile analytics** | Performance data from your connected accounts |

Click the sources icon in the chat input to enable or disable these.

## Tips for better results

**Be specific** - Include platform, tone, and any constraints. "Write a casual LinkedIn post about remote work tips, under 150 words" works better than "Write about remote work."

**Iterate** - AI responses are starting points. Ask follow-up questions to refine: "Make it more conversational" or "Add a call-to-action."

**Leverage your history** - AI knows your past content. Ask it to "write something similar to my best-performing post" or "match the tone of my recent LinkedIn posts."
