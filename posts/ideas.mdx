Ideas are your content backlog—a place to capture inspiration before you're ready to schedule. Build a library of content concepts, develop them over time, and convert them to posts when ready.

## Ideas vs posts

| Aspect | Ideas | Posts |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Ideas backlog | Calendar and posts list |
| **Schedule** | Not scheduled | Scheduled or draft |
| **Purpose** | Capture and develop | Publish |
| **Workflow** | Convert to post when ready | Direct to publishing |

Think of ideas as the "someday" list and posts as the "doing" list.

## Creating ideas

  <Tab title="Quick capture">
    Press `Cmd/Ctrl + I` from anywhere in Ordinal to open quick capture. Jot down your thought and save—it goes straight to your backlog.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From a post">
    Convert an existing draft back to an idea:
    1. Open the post
    2. Click `...` → **Convert to Idea**
    3. The post moves to your Ideas backlog
    
    Useful when you've scheduled something but want to push it back for later.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Idea content

Ideas can contain as much or as little as you need:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Full drafts** | Complete content ready to schedule |
| **Rough outlines** | Key points to develop later |
| **Headlines only** | Just the hook to flesh out |
| **Research notes** | Links, quotes, and references |

<Tip>
Add media to ideas too—images, videos, and documents transfer when you convert to a post.
</Tip>

## Organizing ideas

### Labels

Apply labels to categorize ideas by topic, content type, priority, or campaign theme. Labels make it easy to filter your backlog.

### Platform targeting

Selecting a platform for an idea:
- Sets appropriate character limits in the editor
- Pre-loads platform-specific formatting
- You can change this when converting to a post

## Working with ideas

### Editing

Click any idea to open it. Changes save automatically. Ideas support the same editor features as posts—formatting, mentions, media, AI assistance.

### Collaboration

Team members can:
- View and edit shared ideas
- Leave comments with feedback
- @mention others for input
- See real-time presence

Ideas are workspace-level, visible to all team members with access.

## Converting to posts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the idea">
    Find the idea in your backlog and click to open it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to calendar">
    Click **Add to Calendar** and select a date and time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalize">
    The idea becomes a scheduled post. Review and adjust as needed.
    
    <Check>
    The original idea is marked as "Converted" and linked to the new post.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Alternatively, drag an idea from your backlog directly onto the calendar for quick scheduling.
</Tip>

## Managing your backlog

### Keep it fresh

Review your ideas backlog regularly. Old ideas become stale—archive or delete concepts that are no longer relevant.

### Use labels strategically

Labels like "Ready to schedule," "Needs development," and "Evergreen" help you quickly identify what needs what.

### Batch creation

Dedicate time to brainstorming and capture many ideas at once. Then schedule separate time to develop and convert them. Separating ideation from production improves both.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't find old ideas">
    Check your filters and search. Ideas may be filtered by label or status. Clear filters to see everything.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Idea not converting properly">
    Ensure the idea has required content. If it's missing a platform selection, you'll be prompted to choose one during conversion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quick capture not working">
    The keyboard shortcut only works within the Ordinal app. Ensure the window is focused.
  </Accordion>
