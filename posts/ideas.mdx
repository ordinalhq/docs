Ideas are your content backlog - a place to capture inspiration before you're ready to schedule. Build a library of concepts, develop them over time, and move them to the calendar when ready.

## Creating ideas

1. Go to **Ideas** in the sidebar
2. Click on the `+` button or use the keyboard shortcut `i` to create a new idea
3. Select a channel and write your content

Ideas support the same editor and features as posts - formatting, media, comments, and collaboration all work the same way.

<Tip>
  Add media to ideas too. Images, videos, and documents transfer when you move the idea to calendar.
</Tip>

## Moving ideas to calendar

When you're ready to schedule an idea:

1. Open the idea from your backlog
2. Click **Add to Calendar**. This will automatically move your idea to the Calendar for today's date.
3. Make any edits and schedule the post.

## Moving posts to ideas

Move a post on your Calendar back to your ideas backlog:

1. Open the post
2. Click the **Status** in the sidebar
3. Select **Idea** and confirm
4. The post moves back to the Ideas tab and no longer displays in the Calendar view
