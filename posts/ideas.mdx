Ideas are your content backlog - a place to capture inspiration before you're ready to schedule. Build a library of concepts, develop them over time, and move them to the calendar when ready.

## Creating ideas

1. Go to **Ideas** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Idea** or the `+` button
3. Select a target platform and write your content
4. Optionally apply [labels](/posts/labels) to categorize

Ideas support the same editor and features as posts - formatting, media, comments, and collaboration all work the same way.

<Tip>
  Add media to ideas too. Images, videos, and documents transfer when you move the idea to calendar.
</Tip>

## Organizing ideas

Apply labels to categorize ideas by topic, priority, or theme. Filter your backlog by label to quickly find what you need. See [Labels](/posts/labels) for more.

## Moving ideas to calendar

When you're ready to schedule an idea:

1. Open the idea from your backlog
2. Click **Add to Calendar** and select a date and time
3. The idea becomes a scheduled post

You can also drag an idea directly onto the calendar for quick scheduling.

## Moving posts to ideas

Push a scheduled post back to your ideas backlog:

1. Open the post
2. Click `...` → **Convert to Idea**
3. The post moves to Ideas

Useful when you've scheduled something but want to save it for later.
