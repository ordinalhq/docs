Slack Boost notifies your team via Slack when posts publish, encouraging them to engage and amplify your content's reach. Turn employees into advocates by making it easy to find and interact with your social content.

## How Slack Boost works

1. You configure Slack Boost for a post (or enable it by default)
2. Once the post publishes to social platform(s), Ordinal sends a notification to your configured Slack channel
4. Your team sees the live post with direct links
5. Team members engage - likes, comments, shares - boosting visibility

The Slack message includes:

- Post title (links to the post in Ordinal)
- Button to view on each platform where it published
- Your custom message, if you added one

## Setting up Slack Boost

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Slack">
    Go to **Settings → Slack** and click **Connect Slack**. Authorize Ordinal to access your Slack workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add boost channels">
    In the Slack Boost section, click **Add Channel** and select which Slack channels should receive boost notifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable auto-boost (optional)">
    Toggle **Auto-boost** on a channel to notify on every post automatically. You can still remove boosts from individual posts.

    <Check>
      Slack Boost is configured. Posts will now notify your team.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Slack Boost to posts

### Manual boost

1. Open a post and scroll to **Post Automations**
2. Click **\+ Slack Boost**
3. Select the Slack channel
4. Add a custom message (optional)

When the post publishes, your configured channels receive the notification.

### Auto-boost

When auto-boost is enabled on a channel, every new post automatically includes a Slack Boost to that channel. Remove the boost from individual posts if not needed.

<Tip>
  Don't over-notify. Reserve boosts for content where engagement genuinely matters - auto-boosting everything leads to notification fatigue.
</Tip>

## Choosing the right channel

Target the right audience for each post. A company announcement might go to `#all-hands` while a product feature post goes to `#product-team`.

| Channel example | Use case               |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `#social-boost` | All boost requests     |
| `#marketing`    | Marketing team content |
| `#leadership`   | Executive posts        |
