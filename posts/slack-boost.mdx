Slack Boost notifies your team via Slack when posts publish, encouraging them to engage and amplify your content's reach. Turn employees into advocates by making it easy to find and interact with your social content.

## How Slack Boost works

1. You configure Slack Boost for a post (or enable it by default)
2. The post publishes to social platforms
3. Ordinal sends a notification to your configured Slack channel
4. Your team sees the live post with direct links
5. Team members engage—likes, comments, shares—boosting visibility

The Slack message includes:
- Post title and preview
- Links to view on each platform
- Link to view in Ordinal
- Any custom notes you added

## Setting up Slack Boost

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Slack">
    Go to **Settings → Slack** and click **Connect Slack**. Authorize Ordinal to access your Slack workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure boost channels">
    In the Slack Boost section, click **Add Channel** and select which Slack channels should receive boost notifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable auto-boost (optional)">
    Toggle **Auto-boost** to notify on every post automatically. You can disable it on individual posts.
    
    <Check>
    Slack Boost is configured. Posts will now notify your team.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Slack Boost to posts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual boost">
    For individual posts:
    
    1. Open the post
    2. Find **Slack Boost** in the sidebar
    3. Click to add a boost
    4. Select the Slack channel(s)
    5. Add a custom message (optional)
    
    When the post publishes, your configured channels receive the notification.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Auto-boost">
    When auto-boost is enabled:
    
    - Every new post automatically includes Slack Boost
    - Posts notify your default boost channels
    - Remove the boost from individual posts if not needed
    
    <Tip>
    Auto-boost ensures nothing slips through, but don't over-notify. Reserve boosts for content where engagement genuinely matters.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

## Custom messages

Add context to help your team engage meaningfully:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Default** | Just the post link and platform buttons |
| **Announcement** | "Our big product launch is live! Please like and share 🚀" |
| **Request** | "Key messaging for Q4—comments especially helpful" |
| **Urgency** | "Going for reach—please engage within the first hour" |

Custom messages help team members understand the ask and engage appropriately.

## Choosing the right channel

Create dedicated Slack channels for boost requests:

| Channel | Use case |
|---------|----------|
| `#social-boost` | All boost requests |
| `#marketing-boost` | Marketing team only |
| `#leadership-engagement` | Executive content |
| `#product-team` | Product-focused posts |

Different channels let you target the right audience for different content. A company announcement might go to `#all-hands` while a feature post goes to `#product-team`.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Engage authentically">
    Encourage meaningful comments over generic reactions. A thoughtful comment from a real employee carries more weight than a dozen likes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stagger engagement">
    Suggest team members engage over the first hour rather than all at once. Gradual engagement looks more organic to platform algorithms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match expertise">
    Have team members engage with content relevant to their role. A sales leader commenting on customer success is more credible than random likes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't over-boost">
    Reserve boost requests for content where engagement matters. Too many requests leads to notification fatigue and lower participation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Removing Slack Boost

To prevent a specific post from notifying Slack:

1. Open the post
2. Find the Slack Boost section
3. Toggle it off or click Remove
4. That post won't notify Slack when it publishes

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team not receiving notifications">
    - Verify Slack is connected in **Settings → Slack**
    - Check the channel permissions in Slack
    - Ensure the Ordinal app is added to the target channel
    - Re-authorize if the connection expired
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong channel receiving notifications">
    Review your Slack Boost configuration in Settings. Check which channels are set as default and which are selected on individual posts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Low participation">
    - Make boost requests easy to act on with direct links
    - Add clear calls-to-action in custom messages
    - Don't over-notify—boost fatigue reduces engagement
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
