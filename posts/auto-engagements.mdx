Auto-engagements allow you to automatically add likes, comments, and/or reposts to posts scheduled through Ordinal from any of your connected accounts. This makes it easy for your team to engage with content without having to manually remember to engage with every post.

<Note>
  **Plan availability:** Starter workspaces can only add auto-engagements from the same account as the posting account. Pro workspaces can use any connected account for auto-engagements.

## Engagement types

| Type             | What it does                                             | Timing                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Auto-Like**    | Connected profiles like your post                        | Trickles in over 10 minutes after posting  |
| **Auto-Comment** | Add a first comment (great for CTAs, hashtags, or links) | Configurable delay (immediate to 24 hours) |
| **Auto-Repost**  | Reshare from another connected account                   | Configurable delay (immediate to 24 hours) |

## Platform support

Not all platforms support all engagement types due to API limitations:

| Platform  | Auto-Like | Auto-Comment | Auto-Repost |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| LinkedIn  | ✅         | ✅            | ✅           |
| Twitter/X | ✅         | ✅            | ✅           |
| Instagram | ❌         | ✅            | ❌           |
| Facebook  | ❌         | ✅            | ❌           |

For platform-specific details, see each [channel's documentation](/social-profiles/overview).

## Setting up auto-engagements

1. Open a post and scroll to the **Auto-Engagement** section
2. Click the engagement type(s) you want to add (Like, Comment, or Repost)
3. Select which connected account(s) should perform the action
4. For comments and reposts, write the content and set a delay
5. Engagements fire automatically when the post publishes

<Check>
  Auto-engagements are configured per post. They only run once when the post publishes.
</Check>

## Timing

- **Auto-Likes** trickle in automatically over 10 minutes after posting - no configuration needed
- **Auto-Comments and Reposts** let you set a custom delay from immediate to 24 hours

<Note>
  Note: auto-engagements must be added **before** the post is published. Adding auto-engagements after a post has already been published from Ordinal will not work.
</Note>

## Best practices

- **Use responsibly**  -  A few strategic engagements complement genuine activity. Don't overdo it.
- **Vary your patterns**  -  Avoid identical timing or comments on every post.
- **Add value with comments**  -  Generic "Great post!" comments don't help. Add context, a question, or a useful link.
