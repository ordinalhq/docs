## Overview

Auto-Engagements automatically perform engagement actions on your posts to boost visibility and reach. Set up rules to like, comment, or share content automatically.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Engagement Rules">
    Define what actions you want to automate—likes, comments, or shares.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Triggers">
    Choose when engagements should happen—immediately after posting, after a delay, or at specific times.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Profiles">
    Pick which connected accounts should perform the engagement actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate">
    Enable the rule and let Ordinal handle the rest.
    
    <Check>
    Active rules show a green "Active" badge in the Auto-Engagements list.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Engagement Types

### Auto-Like

Automatically like your own posts from connected profiles:
- Boost initial engagement
- Signal quality to algorithms
- Increase visibility

### Auto-Comment

Add automatic first comments:
- Additional context or links
- Call-to-action
- Hashtag placement

<Tip>
Use auto-comments to add hashtags without cluttering your main post caption—a popular strategy on Instagram.
</Tip>

### Auto-Share

Automatically share posts to other profiles:
- Cross-promote between accounts
- Amplify reach
- Coordinate team sharing

## Setting Up Auto-Engagements

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Auto-Engagements">
    Go to **Auto-Engagements** → **New Rule** in your dashboard.

  <Step title="Select Engagement Type">
    Choose whether to auto-like, auto-comment, or auto-share.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Triggers">
    Set when the engagement should happen:
    - **Immediately** - Right after post publishes
    - **Delayed** - After 5, 15, or 30 minutes
    - **Scheduled** - At specific times
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Participating Profiles">
    Choose which accounts will perform the engagement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate the Rule">
    Toggle the rule to active.
    
    <Check>
    Your new rule appears in the Auto-Engagements list with an "Active" status.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Warning>
Use auto-engagements responsibly. Excessive automation can appear inauthentic and may violate platform terms of service.
</Warning>

- **Be authentic** - Don't overdo automated engagement
- **Add value** - Auto-comments should be meaningful, not spammy
- **Stay compliant** - Follow each platform's automation guidelines
- **Monitor results** - Adjust based on performance and feedback

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Engagements not firing">
    Check that the rule is active and the triggering conditions match your posts. Verify the engaging profile is connected and authorized.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-comment not appearing">
    Some platforms may flag or delay automated comments. Try increasing the delay time or varying comment text.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Platform warning or restriction">
    Reduce automation frequency immediately. Each platform has different thresholds for automated behavior.
