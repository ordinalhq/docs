Auto-engagements automatically perform engagement actions on your posts after they publish. Configure connected profiles to like, comment, or interact with your content, boosting initial visibility and engagement signals.

## How auto-engagements work

When you publish a post, auto-engagements trigger based on your configuration:

1. Post publishes to the platform
2. After a configurable delay, engagement profiles interact with the post
3. Each engagement appears as activity on the platform
4. The post benefits from early engagement signals

Delays help engagements appear natural rather than immediate.

## Engagement types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto-like">
    Connected engagement profiles automatically like your post after publishing.
    
    **Good for:**
    - Boosting initial engagement metrics
    - Signaling quality to platform algorithms
    - Increasing visibility in feeds
    
    Likes are simple and low-risk. They provide a baseline of engagement without requiring content.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Auto-comment">
    Add an automatic first comment after your post publishes.
    
    **Common uses:**
    - Adding context or a call-to-action
    - Placing hashtags in comments (popular on Instagram)
    - Asking a question to prompt discussion
    - Adding links you don't want in the main post
    
    <Tip>
    On Instagram, putting hashtags in the first comment keeps your caption clean while maintaining discoverability.

## Setting up auto-engagements

Auto-engagements require **engagement profiles**—accounts connected specifically for interaction rather than publishing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect engagement profiles">
    Go to **Settings → Profiles → Engagement** and connect accounts you want to use for engagement actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure on a post">
    When creating or editing a post, find the **Auto-Engagement** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select profiles and actions">
    Choose which profiles should engage and what actions to take (like, comment).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set delays">
    Configure when engagements should fire—30 seconds to hours after publishing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add comment content">
    For auto-comments, write the comment content.
    
    <Check>
    Engagements are configured. They'll fire automatically when the post publishes.

  </Step>

## Platform support

| Platform | Auto-Like | Auto-Comment |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| LinkedIn | ✅ | ✅ |
| Twitter/X | ✅ | ✅ |
| Instagram | ✅ | ✅ |
| Facebook | ✅ | ✅ |

<Note>
Engagement actions use the connected profile's authorization. If a profile becomes disconnected, scheduled engagements won't execute.
</Note>

## Timing and delays

Configure when engagements fire relative to post publication:

| Delay | Use case |
|-------|----------|
| **30 seconds** | Minimum delay to ensure post is available |
| **5-15 minutes** | Quick boost while still appearing natural |
| **30+ minutes** | Spread engagements for organic appearance |
| **Hours** | Stagger across multiple profiles |

<Tip>
Staggering engagements from multiple profiles across different delays looks more organic than simultaneous actions from everyone.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<Warning>
Use auto-engagements responsibly. Excessive automation can appear inauthentic and may trigger platform rate limits.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use responsibly">
    Automated engagement should complement genuine activity, not replace it. Keep it modest—a few strategic engagements, not dozens.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vary patterns">
    Don't use identical timing or comments on every post. Platforms may flag repetitive automated behavior.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add value with comments">
    Auto-comments should be substantive. Generic "Great post!" comments don't add value and may hurt credibility. Consider:
    - Adding relevant context
    - Asking a genuine question
    - Providing a useful link
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor for issues">
    Watch for platform warnings or restrictions. Each platform has thresholds for automated activity. Adjust if you see issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring engagements

View the status of auto-engagements in the post detail view:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Pending | Scheduled to fire at a specific time |
| Completed | Successfully executed with timestamp |
| Failed | Error occurred—check details |

If an engagement fails (profile disconnected, rate limited), you'll see the error and can retry or adjust.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Engagements not firing">
    - Verify the rule is configured on the post
    - Check that engagement profiles are still connected
    - Ensure the post actually published successfully
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-comment not appearing">
    Some platforms may delay or filter automated comments. Try:
    - Increasing the delay time
    - Varying comment text between posts
    - Checking for platform restrictions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Platform warning or restriction">
    Reduce automation frequency immediately. Disconnect the affected profile temporarily if needed. Each platform has different thresholds.
  </Accordion>
