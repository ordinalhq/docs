## Overview

Auto-Engagements automatically perform engagement actions on your posts to boost visibility and reach. Set up rules to like, comment, or share content automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Create engagement rules** - Define what actions to take
2. **Set triggers** - When should engagements happen
3. **Select profiles** - Which accounts should engage
4. **Automatic execution** - Ordinal handles the rest

## Engagement Types

### Auto-Like

Automatically like your own posts from connected profiles:
- Boost initial engagement
- Signal quality to algorithms
- Increase visibility

### Auto-Comment

Add automatic first comments:
- Additional context or links
- Call-to-action
- Hashtag placement

### Auto-Share

Automatically share posts to other profiles:
- Cross-promote between accounts
- Amplify reach
- Coordinate team sharing

## Setting Up Auto-Engagements

1. Go to **Auto-Engagements** → **New Rule**
2. Select engagement type
3. Choose triggering conditions
4. Select participating profiles
5. Set timing (immediate or delayed)
6. Activate the rule

## Best Practices

<Warning>
Use auto-engagements responsibly. Excessive automation can appear inauthentic and may violate platform terms of service.
</Warning>

- **Be authentic** - Don't overdo automated engagement
- **Add value** - Auto-comments should be meaningful
- **Stay compliant** - Follow platform guidelines
- **Monitor results** - Adjust based on performance
