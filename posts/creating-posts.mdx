Every piece of content in Ordinal starts with creating a post. Once created, you can draft your content, add media, configure settings, and schedule it for publishing. Here's how to get started.

## Ways to create a post

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Keyboard shortcut">
    Press `P` anywhere in Ordinal to instantly open the create post modal. This is the fastest way to start a new post—no clicking required.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Calendar">
    Click any date on the calendar to create a post for that day. If you click and drag across a time slot, the post opens with that specific time pre-filled—great for visual planning.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Command palette">
    Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to open the command palette, type "new post", and hit Enter. Useful when you're already navigating with the keyboard.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From an idea">
    Have an idea you're ready to publish? Open it from your Ideas backlog and click **Add to Calendar**. The idea converts to a schedulable post with all your content preserved.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Duplicate an existing post">
    Want to reuse content from a previous post? Open any existing post, click the **...** menu, and select **Duplicate**. A copy opens with all content and settings preserved—just update the schedule.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The create post modal

When you create a new post, a modal opens where you'll configure the basics before diving into the full editor.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Title** | Give your post an internal name for organization. This is never published—only your team sees it. Required. |
| **Publish Date** | When should this post go live? Select a date from the calendar picker. Required. |
| **Publish Time** | Optionally set a specific time. Ordinal may suggest optimal times based on your past performance. |
| **Channel** | Which platform are you posting to? Select LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc. You can add more channels after creation. Required. |
| **Status** | Set the workflow status—typically **Draft** for work in progress or **Finalized** when ready for review. |
| **Labels** | Optionally tag with labels to categorize by content type, topic, or campaign. |
| **Open Post Page** | Toggle on to immediately open the full post editor after creation. Toggle off to stay on your current page. |

<Tip>
If you frequently post to the same account, set it as your default in [Post Defaults](/posts/post-defaults) to skip selecting it each time.
</Tip>

Once you click **Create**, your post is saved and you can start drafting your content in the full editor.
