Every piece of content in Ordinal starts with creating a post. Once created, you can draft your content, add media, configure settings, and schedule it for publishing. Here's how to get started.

## How to Create a Post

## Create Post Modal

When you create a new post, a modal opens where you'll configure the basics before diving into the full editor.

| Option             | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**          | Give your post a descriptive title                                                                          |
| **Publish Date**   | Date for the post                                                                                           |
| **Publish Time**   | Optionally choose a time for the post. You can also set this later on the Post Page itself.                 |
| **Channel**        | Select the channel the post should go to. You can add cross-post channels later.                            |
| **Labels**         | Optionally tag with labels to categorize by content type or topic.                                          |
| **Open Post Page** | Toggle on to immediately open the full post editor after creation. Toggle off to stay on your current page. |

<Tip>
  If you frequently post to the same account, set it as your default in [Post Defaults](/posts/post-defaults) to skip selecting it each time.

Once you click **Create**, your post is saved and you can start drafting your content in the full editor.
