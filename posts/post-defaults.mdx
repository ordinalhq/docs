Post defaults save time by pre-selecting your most common settings. When you create a new post, your preferred channels, accounts, and platform-specific options are already configured.

## What can be defaulted

Configure defaults for:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default accounts** | Which account to use for each platform |
| **Instagram location** | Pre-filled location tag |
| **Instagram Reel settings** | Share to Feed toggle |
| **YouTube Shorts settings** | Notify subscribers toggle |
| **Webflow preview type** | Live or Designer preview |

## Setting up defaults

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Go to **Settings** in the sidebar and select **Post Defaults**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure each platform">
    For each platform you use regularly:
    - Select your default account from the dropdown
    - Only connected accounts appear as options
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set platform-specific options">
    Configure platform-specific defaults:
    - **Instagram:** Default location, Share Reel to Feed
    - **YouTube Shorts:** Notify subscribers
    - **Webflow:** Preview type (Live or Designer)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Changes save automatically as you make them.
    
    <Check>
    New posts will now use these defaults.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Default accounts

Set which account is pre-selected when you create a post for each platform:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LinkedIn">
    Choose between your connected LinkedIn profiles and Company pages. If you manage multiple, pick the one you post from most often.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Twitter/X">
    Select your primary Twitter account if you have multiple connected.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Instagram">
    Choose your default Instagram Business or Creator account.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other platforms">
    Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Threads, Slack, Discord, and Webflow all support default account selection.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
If you frequently post to the same account, setting it as default eliminates a click on every post.
</Tip>

## Platform-specific defaults

### Instagram

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Default Location | Any saved location | Pre-fills the location tag on Instagram posts |
| Share Reel to Feed | On / Off | Whether Reels also appear in your main feed |

Location defaults are especially useful if you always post from the same location (office, store, event venue).

### YouTube Shorts

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Notify Subscribers | On / Off | Whether to send notifications when you post |

### Webflow

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Preview Type | Live / Designer | How Webflow posts preview in Ordinal |

## When defaults apply

Defaults are used when:
- Creating a new post via the `P` keyboard shortcut
- Clicking on the calendar to create a post
- Using the command palette to create a post

Defaults are **not** used when:
- **Duplicating a post** — Uses the original post's settings
- **Converting an idea** — Uses settings from the idea
- **Editing existing posts** — Keeps current settings

## Overriding defaults

Defaults are starting points, not constraints. In any post:

1. Change the account in the post sidebar
2. Modify any platform-specific setting
3. Add or remove channels

Changes only affect that specific post. Your defaults remain unchanged for future posts.

## Workspace-level defaults

Post defaults are configured at the workspace level:
- All team members use the same defaults
- Any team member with settings access can modify them
- Changes affect all future posts in the workspace

<Note>
If your team members work on different accounts, defaults may be less useful. Consider not setting defaults and letting each person select manually.
</Note>

## Best practices

**Set your most-used accounts** — The account you use 80% of the time should be the default.

**Review periodically** — As your strategy changes, update defaults to match.

**Use for consistency** — Defaults like Instagram location help maintain consistency across posts.

**Don't set if you vary** — If you switch accounts frequently, defaults may create more work (changing from the wrong default) than they save.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Defaults not applying">
    - Verify you're in the correct workspace
    - Check **Settings → Post Defaults** to confirm they're set
    - Try refreshing the page
    - Defaults don't apply when duplicating or converting ideas
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account missing from dropdown">
    Only connected accounts appear. If an account is missing:
    - Go to **Settings → Profiles**
    - Connect the account
    - Return to Post Defaults to select it
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Someone else changed my defaults">
    Post defaults are workspace-level, so any team member with settings access can modify them. Coordinate with your team on preferred settings.
  </Accordion>
