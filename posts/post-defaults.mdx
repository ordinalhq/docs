Post defaults save time by pre-selecting your most common settings. When you create a new post, your preferred accounts and platform-specific options are already configured.

## Setting up defaults

Go to [**Settings → Post Defaults**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/post-defaults) to configure:

| Setting                     | Description                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Default accounts**        | Which account to use for each platform |
| **Instagram location**      | Pre-filled location tag                |
| **Instagram Reel settings** | Share to Feed toggle                   |
| **YouTube Shorts settings** | Notify subscribers toggle              |
| **Webflow preview type**    | Live or Designer preview               |

Changes save automatically - only connected accounts will appear as options.

<Tip>
  Set your most-used account as the default for each platform. If you post to the same account 80% of the time, this eliminates a click on every post.

## When defaults apply

Defaults are used globally when creating new posts.

Defaults are **not** used when:

- **Duplicating a post**  -  Uses the original post's settings
- **Converting an idea**  -  Uses settings from the idea

You can always override defaults in any individual post - changes only affect that post, not your saved defaults.

## Workspace-level setting

Post defaults are configured at the workspace level. All team members share the same defaults, and anyone with settings access can modify them.

<Note>
  If your team members frequently post to different accounts, you may want to skip setting defaults and let each person select manually.
