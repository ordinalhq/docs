Posts are the core content unit in Ordinal. A post contains your content, media, and settings for publishing to one or more social profiles. Posts progress through a workflow from draft to published, with optional approval gates along the way.

## Creating a post

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Keyboard">
    Press `P` anywhere in Ordinal to instantly open a new post. This is the fastest method.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Calendar">
    Click any date on the calendar to create a post scheduled for that day. Click and drag to select a specific time slot.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Command palette">
    Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`, type "new post", and press Enter.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From an idea">
    Open an idea from your backlog and click **Add to Calendar** to convert it to a schedulable post.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
The calendar method is particularly useful for visual planning—your post opens with the selected date and time pre-filled.
</Tip>

## The post composer

When you create a post, the composer opens with key areas:

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Channel selector** | Choose platforms to publish to |
| **Content editor** | Write with formatting, mentions, and media |
| **Sidebar** | Configure title, campaign, labels, schedule, accounts |
| **Preview** | See how your post will appear on each platform |

For cross-posts, each platform gets its own tab with platform-specific character limits and media requirements.

## Writing content

The editor supports rich content creation:

- **Text formatting** — Bold, italic, and links via toolbar or keyboard shortcuts
- **@mentions** — Tag people, companies, or accounts
- **Hashtags** — Add discoverability with `#` tags
- **Slash commands** — Type `/` for quick access to media, AI, and more

## AI assistance

Generate and refine content with AI:

1. Type `/ai` or click the AI button (✨)
2. Describe what you want to create
3. AI generates content you can edit and refine

AI can also improve existing text—select content and choose to make it shorter, longer, change tone, or fix grammar.

## Post settings

### Title

The internal title helps you organize and search posts. It's never published—only visible to your team. If left blank, Ordinal auto-generates from your content.

### Account selection

Choose which connected account to post from for each platform. Set default accounts in [Post Defaults](/posts/post-defaults) to save time.

### Labels

Apply labels to categorize posts by campaign, content type, topic, or any taxonomy your team uses. Labels enable filtering across the calendar and post lists.

### Campaign

Associate posts with a campaign to group related content together. Campaign posts share a timeline and aggregate analytics.

## Saving and drafts

<Check>
Your work saves automatically as you type. Look for the "Saved" indicator to confirm.
</Check>

Posts remain as drafts until you schedule them. Drafts:
- Won't publish automatically
- Can be edited without time pressure
- Appear in Posts filtered by "Draft" status

To schedule a draft, set a publish date and time or click **Post Now** for immediate publishing.

## Real-time collaboration

Multiple team members can work on the same post simultaneously:

- Presence indicators show who's viewing
- Live cursors show where others are editing
- Changes sync instantly—no version conflicts

For detailed feedback, use comments instead of editing directly.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't see channel options">
    Verify you have connected accounts in **Settings → Profiles → Scheduling**. Only connected profiles appear as channel options.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Post not saving">
    Check your internet connection. Ensure all required fields are filled. Try refreshing if issues persist.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong account selected">
    Change the account in the post sidebar. Update [Post Defaults](/posts/post-defaults) to change future defaults.
