Once you've created a post, this is where your content comes to life. The editor gives you everything you need - a rich text experience, real-time previews, and collaborative tools - all designed to help you write and refine faster.

## Text Formatting

![Post Editor Formatting Bar](/images/posteditor-formattingbar.jpg)

Format your content using the toolbar or keyboard shortcuts:

| Format   | Shortcut       |
| -------- | -------------- |
| **Bold** | `Cmd/Ctrl + B` |
| _Italic_ | `Cmd/Ctrl + I` |
| Link     | `Cmd/Ctrl + K` |

## Mentions

Tag people, companies, and accounts by typing `@` followed by their name. Ordinal searches the platform for matches - select from the dropdown.

Mentions are supported on all platforms. See your [channel's page](/social-profiles/overview) for details on how tagging works for each specific platform.

## Hashtags

Add hashtags by typing `#` followed by your tag. They'll automatically link when published.

Hashtags are supported on all platforms. See your [channel's page](/social-profiles/overview) for platform-specific recommendations.

## Preview

![X Feed Preview](/images/x-feed-preview.jpg)

The editor shows a live preview of your post as you type - including proper text truncation with "see more" exactly where the platform would cut off on channels like LinkedIn.

For an even more realistic view, click the **Feed Preview** button (available on LinkedIn and Twitter/X) to see your post in a full feed context with your profile picture, desktop/mobile views, and engagement buttons.

## Saving

Posts won't publish until you click **Schedule Post** or **Post Now**.

## Collaboration

### Real-time editing

Multiple team members can edit the same post simultaneously:

- **Presence indicators** show who's viewing
- **Live cursors** show where others are typing
- Changes sync instantly with no version conflicts

### Inline Comments

For detailed feedback, leave comments directly on the content instead of editing:

1. Select text in the editor
2. Click the comment icon that appears
3. Add your feedback, tag teammates to call them out, and all subscribers to the post are notified

Comments create threaded conversations attached to specific text, making it easy to discuss changes without losing context.

## AI writing
