## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Media not uploading">
    Check file size limits: images under 20MB, videos under 512MB. Ensure you're using supported formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4, MOV).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Character count incorrect">
    URLs are counted differently per platform. Twitter/X counts all URLs as 23 characters regardless of length.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview not matching platform">
    Previews are approximations. Minor differences may appear on the actual platform due to device variations.
