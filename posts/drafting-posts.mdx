Once you've opened the post composer, this is where your content comes to life. The editor is built for speed—keyboard shortcuts, slash commands, and real-time collaboration help you write and refine faster.

## Text formatting

Format your content using the toolbar or keyboard shortcuts:

| Format | Shortcut | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Bold** | `Cmd/Ctrl + B` | Unicode bold on LinkedIn/Twitter |
| *Italic* | `Cmd/Ctrl + I` | Unicode italic on LinkedIn/Twitter |
| Link | `Cmd/Ctrl + K` | Opens link dialog |

<Note>
LinkedIn and Twitter don't support native rich text, so Ordinal uses Unicode characters that render as bold or italic. The result looks right on the platform even though it's technically plain text.
</Note>

### Platform formatting support

| Platform | Bold/Italic | Clickable Links |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| LinkedIn | ✅ Unicode | ✅ |
| Twitter/X | ✅ Unicode | ✅ |
| Instagram | ❌ | ❌ Caption only |
| Facebook | ❌ | ✅ |
| Threads | ✅ | ✅ |

## Mentions

Tag people, companies, and accounts by typing `@` followed by their name. Ordinal searches the platform for matches—select from the dropdown.

| Platform | What you can mention |
|----------|---------------------|
| LinkedIn | People and Company pages |
| Twitter/X | User accounts |
| Instagram | User accounts (Business/Creator only) |
| Facebook | Pages (not personal profiles) |
| Threads | User accounts |

Mentions become clickable links when published and may notify the tagged account.

## Hashtags

Type `#` followed by your tag. Recommended counts vary by platform:

| Platform | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| LinkedIn | 3-5 |
| Instagram | 5-10 |
| Twitter/X | 1-3 |
| TikTok | 3-5 |

<Tip>
On Instagram, consider putting hashtags in a first comment (via auto-engagement) rather than the caption.
</Tip>

## Links

Paste URLs directly or select text and press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to add a link.

LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook generate preview cards for links. On LinkedIn, you can customize the preview title and thumbnail image.

<Tip>
Use [link shorteners](/analytics/shortlinks) to track clicks with detailed analytics.
</Tip>

## Slash commands

Type `/` at the start of a line:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/ai` | Open AI writing assistant |
| `/image` | Insert an image |
| `/video` | Insert a video |
| `/link` | Insert a link |

## Character limits

The editor shows real-time character counts. The counter turns red as you approach the limit.

| Platform | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Twitter/X | 280 (4,000 with Premium) |
| LinkedIn | 3,000 |
| Instagram | 2,200 |
| Facebook | 63,206 |
| Threads | 500 |
| TikTok | 2,200 |

## Post settings

Configure these options in the sidebar:

- **Title** — Internal name for organizing and searching. Never published.
- **Account** — Which connected account to post from. Set defaults in [Post Defaults](/posts/post-defaults).
- **Labels** — Categorize by content type, topic, or campaign. Press `L` to open.
- **Campaign** — Group related posts together for shared timelines and analytics.
- **Notes** — Internal notes or creative briefs only your team can see.
- **Status** — Workflow status (Draft → Finalized). See [Post Statuses](/posts/statuses).

## Saving

<Check>
Your work saves automatically as you type. Look for the "Saved" indicator.
</Check>

Posts remain as drafts until scheduled. Drafts won't publish automatically and can be edited without time pressure.

## Collaboration

Multiple team members can edit the same post simultaneously—presence indicators show who's viewing, and live cursors show where others are typing. Changes sync instantly with no version conflicts.

For detailed feedback, use comments instead of editing directly.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + B` | Bold |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + I` | Italic |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + K` | Insert link |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Save post |
| `Escape` | Close editor |
| `/` | Slash commands |
| `@` | Mention |
| `#` | Hashtag |
| `L` | Open labels |
