When you delete a post, it's moved to **Trash** rather than being permanently removed. Archived posts stay in Trash for 30 days before being automatically deleted.

## Accessing Trash

Open **Trash** from the sidebar under Posts to view all archived posts in your workspace. Posts are listed with when they were archived and who archived them.

## Restoring posts

To restore an archived post:

1. Open the post from the Trash page, or
2. Click **Restore** in the alert banner when viewing an archived post

Restored posts return to your calendar and can be edited and scheduled as normal.

## Permanently deleting

Archived posts are automatically permanently deleted after 30 days. To delete immediately:

1. Open the archived post
2. Click **Delete Immediately** in the alert banner
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Permanent deletion cannot be undone. The post and all its content will be removed from Ordinal.
</Warning>

## What gets archived

- **Posts and ideas** — Both can be archived from the same menu
- **Scheduled posts** — Archiving cancels the scheduled publish
- **Published posts** — Archiving in Ordinal does not remove the post from social platforms
