Media drives engagement on social platforms. Ordinal supports images, videos, GIFs, and documents across all your connected profiles, with automatic optimization for each platform's requirements.

![Media Assets](/images/media-assets.jpg)

## Adding media

There are several ways to add media to your post:

- **Drag and drop** — Drop files directly into the editor
- **Click the media button** — Click the (+) button to browse your computer
- **Paste from clipboard** — `Cmd/Ctrl + V` for screenshots or copied images

## Editing images

Click on any uploaded image to open the built-in image editor. You can make adjustments before publishing without leaving Ordinal.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Crop">
    Select from preset aspect ratios or enter a custom ratio.

    **Presets include:**

    - Square (1:1) — Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook
    - Portrait (4:5) — Instagram Feed, Facebook
    - Landscape (16:9) — Twitter, YouTube
    - Vertical (9:16) — Reels, Stories, TikTok, YouTube Shorts

    You can also type a custom aspect ratio (e.g., "3:2") for specific needs.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Transform">
    - **Rotate** — Rotate left or right in 90° increments
    - **Flip** — Flip horizontally or vertically
    - **Resize** — Scale the image dimensions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Adjust">
    - **Finetune** — Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and other settings
    - **Filter** — Apply preset filters for different looks
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Annotate">
    - **Annotate** — Draw or add text directly on the image
    - **Decorate** — Add stickers, shapes, or decorative elements
    - **Frame** — Add borders or frames around the image
    - **Redact** — Blur or block out sensitive information
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  When you save edits, Ordinal automatically compresses oversized files to meet platform limits.
</Note>

## Reordering assets

For posts with multiple images or videos, drag and drop to reorder them. The order you set is the order they'll appear in the published post.

On platforms that support carousels (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Threads), the first image becomes the cover that users see before swiping.

## Downloading assets

To download media from a post:

1. Hover over the asset
2. Click the **download icon** that appears

This saves the file to your computer—useful for repurposing content or keeping local backups.

## Deleting assets

To remove media from a post:

1. Hover over the asset
2. Click the **trash icon** that appears

Deleted assets are removed from the post but remain in your workspace's asset library if you need them later.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload failing">
    - **Check file size** — Images under 10MB, videos under 500MB
    - **Check format** — JPG, PNG, GIF for images; MP4, MOV for video
    - **Try refreshing** — Connection issues can interrupt uploads
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Video not playing in preview">
    - Ensure video uses H.264 codec
    - Try re-encoding with a tool like HandBrake
    - Verify the file isn't corrupted
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Image cropped unexpectedly">
    Each platform crops to its preferred aspect ratio. Use the image editor to crop to the right dimensions before publishing, and preview to see exactly how it will appear.
