Every post has a status that indicates where it is in the publishing lifecycle. Statuses help you and your team understand what's scheduled, what's live, and what needs attention.

## Status lifecycle

Posts flow through statuses as they progress toward publication:

```
Draft → Scheduled → In Progress → Posted
                              ↘ Failed
```

| Status | Color | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Gray | Work in progress, not scheduled |
| **Scheduled** | Yellow | Set to publish at a future time |
| **In Progress** | Blue | Currently being sent to the platform |
| **Posted** | Green | Successfully published and live |
| **Failed** | Red | Publishing failed, requires attention |

## Handling failed posts

When a post fails, you'll see an error message. Common causes and solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account disconnected">
    The social profile's authorization expired. Go to **Settings → Profiles**, find the account, and click **Reconnect** to re-authorize.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content too long">
    Your text exceeds the platform's character limit. Edit the post to shorten it, then retry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Media too large">
    File size exceeds platform limits. Compress the image/video or use a smaller file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content rejected">
    The platform flagged the content. Review platform guidelines and adjust accordingly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Platform error">
    Temporary platform outage. Wait a few minutes and retry.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

After fixing the issue, click **Retry** to attempt publishing again.

## Multi-platform status

When a post targets multiple platforms, each channel has its own status:

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| LinkedIn | ✅ Posted |
| Twitter/X | ✅ Posted |
| Instagram | ❌ Failed (media format unsupported) |

View per-channel status in the post detail view. Retry failed channels individually without affecting successful ones.

## Statuses and approvals

If your workspace uses approvals, posts may require approval before scheduling:

| Approval State | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| Pending | Cannot schedule until approved |
| Approved | Can be scheduled normally |
| Rejected | Returns to draft for revision |

With blocking approvals enabled, the Schedule button is disabled until approval is granted.

## Filtering by status

View posts by status throughout Ordinal:

- **Calendar** — Use status filters to show only scheduled, posted, or failed
- **Posts list** — Filter by any status
- **Dashboard** — Quick counts of posts in each status

<Tip>
Enable failure notifications in **Settings → Notifications** to catch failed posts immediately.
