## Overview

Statuses track where each post is in your content workflow. From initial draft to published content, statuses keep everyone aligned.

## Default Statuses

Ordinal includes built-in statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress, not ready for review |
| **Pending Review** | Submitted for approval |
| **Approved** | Ready to be scheduled |
| **Scheduled** | Queued for publishing |
| **Published** | Live on social platforms |
| **Failed** | Publishing failed (requires attention) |

## Custom Statuses

Create custom statuses for your workflow:

1. Go to **Statuses** → **New Status**
2. Enter status name
3. Choose a color
4. Set the position in your workflow
5. Save the status

### Custom Status Examples

- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **Needs Assets** - Waiting for images/video
- **Legal Review** - Requires compliance check
- **Client Approval** - Awaiting client sign-off
- **On Hold** - Paused for now

## Status Workflows

### Moving Posts Through Statuses

Posts move through statuses as they progress:
- Manually update status
- Automatic progression (e.g., approved → scheduled)
- Status changes trigger notifications

### Status-Based Views

Filter your content by status:
- See all drafts that need work
- View posts pending approval
- Track what's scheduled

## Notifications

Get notified on status changes:
- When your post is approved
- When a post fails to publish
- When posts need your review

## Best Practices

Don't create too many statuses. 5-7 is usually sufficient for most workflows.
