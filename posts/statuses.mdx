## Overview

Statuses track where each post is in your content workflow. From initial draft to published content, statuses keep everyone aligned.

## Default Statuses

Ordinal includes built-in statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress, not ready for review |
| **Pending Review** | Submitted for approval |
| **Approved** | Ready to be scheduled |
| **Scheduled** | Queued for publishing |
| **Published** | Live on social platforms |
| **Failed** | Publishing failed (requires attention) |

## Custom Statuses

Create custom statuses to match your workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Statuses">
    Go to **Statuses** → **New Status** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Status Name">
    Choose a clear, descriptive name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Color">
    Select a color for visual identification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Workflow Position">
    Place the status in your workflow sequence (e.g., after Draft, before Approved).
    
    <Tip>
    Keep workflow order logical—status should flow naturally from creation to publication.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create your custom status.
    
    <Check>
    Your new status appears in the workflow and is available for posts.
    </Check>

</Steps>

### Custom Status Examples

- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **Needs Assets** - Waiting for images/video
- **Legal Review** - Requires compliance check
- **Client Approval** - Awaiting client sign-off
- **On Hold** - Paused for now

## Status Workflows

### Moving Posts Through Statuses

Posts move through statuses as they progress:
- Manually update status from the post detail view
- Automatic progression (e.g., approved → scheduled when scheduled)
- Status changes trigger notifications to relevant team members

<Check>
Status changes are logged in the post's activity history for audit purposes.
</Check>

### Status-Based Views

Filter your content by status:
- See all drafts that need work
- View posts pending approval
- Track what's scheduled

## Notifications

Get notified on status changes:
- When your post is approved
- When a post fails to publish
- When posts need your review

<Tip>
Configure status notifications in Settings → Notifications to stay informed without being overwhelmed.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep it simple">
    Don't create too many statuses. 5-7 is usually sufficient for most workflows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clear naming">
    Use status names that clearly indicate what action is needed or what state the post is in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Logical flow">
    Arrange statuses in the order posts typically progress through your workflow.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Status not changing automatically">
    Automatic status changes only occur for specific actions (scheduling, publishing). Manual status updates require user action.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't delete custom status">
    Move all posts off the status before deleting. Posts must be reassigned to another status first.
  </Accordion>
