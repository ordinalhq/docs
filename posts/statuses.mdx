Every post has a status that tracks where it is in your workflow - from early draft through publication. Statuses help you and your team see what's in progress, what's ready, and what needs attention.

## Workflow statuses

Posts can move through these statuses as you work on them. Change status anytime from the post sidebar.

| Status          | Purpose                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Tentative**   | Initial placeholder or rough idea            |
| **To Do**       | Ready to start working on                    |
| **In Progress** | Currently being drafted or refined           |
| **For Review**  | Awaiting feedback from teammates             |
| **Blocked**     | Stuck - waiting on assets, approvals, or input |
| **Finalized**   | Content is complete and ready to schedule    |
| **Scheduled**   | Has a publish date and time set              |
| **Posted**      | Successfully published and live              |

<Tip>
  Use statuses that match your team's workflow. Some teams use all eight; others stick to just a few.

## Publishing states

When a scheduled post's publish time arrives, Ordinal sends content to each platform. Each channel has its own publishing state:

| State         | What it means                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Scheduled** | Queued to publish at the set time      |
| **Posted**    | Successfully published to the platform |
| **Errored**   | Publishing failed - requires attention   |

For cross-posts, each platform publishes independently. One channel can succeed while another fails.

| Platform  | State     |
| --------- | --------- |
| LinkedIn  | ✅ Posted  |
| Twitter/X | ✅ Posted  |
| Instagram | ❌ Errored |

View per-channel status in the post detail view. Retry failed channels individually without affecting successful ones.

## Handling errored posts

When a post fails to publish, you'll see an error message explaining the cause. Common issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account disconnected">
    The social profile's authorization expired. Go to **Settings → Profiles**, find the account, and click **Reconnect**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content too long">
    Your text exceeds the platform's character limit. Edit the post to shorten it, then retry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Media too large">
    File size exceeds platform limits. Compress the image/video or use a smaller file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content rejected">
    The platform flagged the content. Review their guidelines and adjust accordingly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Platform error">
    Temporary platform outage. Wait a few minutes and retry.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

After fixing the issue, click **Retry** to attempt publishing again.

## Approvals and scheduling

If your workspace uses approvals, posts may require sign-off before they can be scheduled. With blocking approvals enabled, the Schedule button stays disabled until approval is granted.
