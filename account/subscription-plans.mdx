## How billing works

- **Billing frequency**: Choose monthly or yearly billing. Annual plans save approximately 10%.
- **Enterprise billing**: Enterprise plans are billed yearly only.

### Adding or removing profiles mid-cycle

- **Adding profiles:** You'll be charged a prorated amount for the remaining days in the current cycle.
- **Removing profiles:** You'll be refunded a prorated amount for the remaining days in the current cycle as credit.

## Managing your billing

### View or change your plan

1. Go to [Settings → Plans](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/pricing)
2. Compare available plans and select the one you want
3. Confirm the change

Changes to your plan take effect immediately and you'll be charged or refunded the prorated amount for the remaining days in the current cycle.

### Update payment method

Go to [Update Payment Method](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/payment-method) to update your payment method.

### View Invoices

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. You'll be redirected to the Stripe billing portal where you can:
   - Update your payment method
   - View and download past invoices
   - See upcoming charges

### Get Emailed Invoices

## Changing or canceling your subscription

### Upgrading

When you upgrade:

- New features are available immediately
- You're charged the prorated difference for the current cycle

### Downgrading

When you downgrade:

- The change takes effect at the end of your billing period
- You keep full access until then
- If you exceed the new plan's limits (e.g., too many social profiles), you'll need to disconnect some before the downgrade takes effect

### Canceling

To cancel your subscription:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Within the Stripe billing portal, click **Cancel Subscription**
3. Confirm the cancellation

<Warning>
  Cancellations take effect at the end of your current billing period. You can reactivate your subscription at any time without losing your data.
</Warning>

After cancellation:

- You retain access until the end of your billing period
- Your data is preserved (nothing is deleted)
- You can reactivate your subscription at any time
