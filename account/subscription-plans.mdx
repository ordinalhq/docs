## How billing works

- **Billing frequency**: Choose monthly or yearly billing. Annual plans save approximately 10%.
- **Enterprise billing**: Enterprise plans are billed yearly only.

### Adding or removing profiles mid-cycle

- **Adding profiles:** You won't be charged until your next billing cycle.
- **Removing profiles:** No credit is issued for the remainder of the current cycle.

## Managing your billing

### View or change your plan

1. Go to **Settings → Plans**
2. Compare available plans and select the one you want
3. Confirm the change

Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period.

### Update payment method or view invoices

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. You'll be redirected to the billing portal where you can:
   - Update your payment method
   - Change your billing email
   - View and download past invoices
   - See upcoming charges

## Changing or canceling your subscription

### Upgrading

When you upgrade:

- New features are available immediately
- You're charged the prorated difference for the current cycle

### Downgrading

When you downgrade:

- The change takes effect at the end of your billing period
- You keep full access until then
- If you exceed the new plan's limits (e.g., too many social profiles), you'll need to disconnect some before the downgrade takes effect

### Canceling

To cancel your subscription:

1. Go to **Settings → Plans**
2. Select **Cancel Subscription**
3. Confirm the cancellation

<Warning>
  We do not provide refunds for cancellations mid-subscription. If you're uncertain about committing to a full year, we recommend starting with a monthly plan.
</Warning>

After cancellation:

- You retain access until the end of your billing period
- Your data is preserved (nothing is deleted)
- You can reactivate your subscription at any time

New workspaces start with a **14-day free trial** - no credit card required. During the trial, you have full access to Pro features. When the trial ends, you can choose a paid plan or continue with limited functionality.
