Notifications keep you informed about activity that matters—posts publishing, approvals pending, comments on your content, and more. Configure delivery channels and frequency to stay updated without being overwhelmed.

## Notification types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Content">
    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Post published | When scheduled posts go live |
    | Post failed | When publishing fails (action needed) |
    | Scheduled reminder | Heads-up before posts publish |
    
    <Warning>
    Always enable failure notifications. Failed posts need immediate attention and shouldn't sit unnoticed.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Collaboration">
    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Comment added | New comments on posts you're subscribed to |
    | Reply to comment | Someone responded to your comment |
    | @Mentioned | Someone tagged you |
    | Approval requested | Someone wants your review |
    | Approval response | Your post was approved or rejected |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Team">
    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | New team member | Someone joined your workspace |
    | Permissions changed | Your access was modified |
    | Profile connected | Social profile status changed |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Delivery channels

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email">
    Receive notifications via email:
    
    | Frequency | When to use |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | **Immediate** | Urgent items like failures |
    | **Daily digest** | Regular updates without constant emails |
    | **Weekly digest** | Low-priority summaries |
    
    <Tip>
    Use immediate for failures and approvals, digests for comments and general activity.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Slack">
    If your workspace has Slack connected:
    
    - **Direct messages** — Personal notifications
    - **Channel messages** — Team notifications
    - **Thread replies** — Keep conversations together
    
    Great for fast response on approvals and mentions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="In-app">
    Notifications appear in Ordinal's notification panel:
    
    - Bell icon shows unread count
    - Click to see recent notifications
    - Click any notification to navigate to source
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mobile push">
    If using the mobile app:
    
    - Push notifications for urgent items
    - Configurable quiet hours
    - Critical alerts can bypass quiet hours
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Steps>

## Quiet hours

Set times when you won't receive notifications:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable quiet hours">
    Toggle on Quiet Hours in notification settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set schedule">
    Define start time, end time, and which days.
    
    <Tip>
    Set quiet hours for evenings and weekends to maintain work-life balance.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure exceptions">
    Optionally allow critical alerts (like failed posts) to bypass quiet hours.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Post subscriptions

You're automatically subscribed to posts you:
- Create
- Comment on
- Are @mentioned in
- Are assigned as approver for

Subscribed posts notify you of comments and status changes.

**To unsubscribe:**
1. Open the post
2. Find the subscription toggle
3. Turn off notifications for this post

## Notification grouping

Reduce volume by grouping similar notifications:

| Grouping | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Multiple comments on one post | Single notification |
| Several pending approvals | One summary |
| Activity from same person | Batched together |

Enable grouping in Settings to reduce noise while staying informed.

## Managing notifications

### Mark as read

- Click individual notifications to mark read
- Use "Mark all as read" to clear your inbox

### Notification history

Access past notifications from the panel. Click any notification to navigate to its source.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prioritize failures">
    Always enable immediate alerts for failed posts. These need action and shouldn't wait for a digest.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use digests for volume">
    If you're getting too many emails, switch high-volume types (comments, activity) to daily digest.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enable Slack for collaboration">
    Approval requests and mentions work well as Slack messages for fast response.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set quiet hours">
    Protect focus time and personal hours. You can always check manually when needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review periodically">
    As your role changes, revisit notification settings. What mattered before may not matter now.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
