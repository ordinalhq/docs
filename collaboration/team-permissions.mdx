Bring your team into Ordinal to collaborate on content together. Team members can create posts, leave feedback, request approvals, and view analytics - all within your shared workspace.

## Inviting members

To add someone to your workspace:

1. Go to [**Settings → Members**](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/members)
2. Enter their email address
3. Click **Invite**

**What happens next depends on whether they already use Ordinal:**

- **Existing Ordinal user**  -  They're added to your workspace immediately and will see it the next time they log in.
- **New to Ordinal**  -  They'll receive an email invitation with a link to create their account.

<Note>
  **Important:** The person must sign up using the exact email address you invited. If they create an account with a different email, they won't have access to the workspace.
</Note>

### Sharing the invite link

After sending an invitation, you can copy the unique invite link to share directly - handy if you want to send it via Slack, text, or another channel. Look for the **Copy Invite Link** option in the success message, or find it in the pending invitations list.

### Managing pending invitations

Invitations that haven't been accepted yet appear in the **Pending** section of the Members page. From here you can:

- **Resend** the invitation email if they didn't receive it
- **Copy** the invite link to share manually
- **Revoke** the invitation if it's no longer needed

## Removing members

If someone leaves your team or no longer needs access:

1. Go to [Settings → Members](https://app.tryordinal.com/settings/members)
2. Find the person you want to remove
3. Click the three dots \> **Remove User** and confirm

They'll lose access to the workspace immediately. Any posts or content they created will remain in the workspace - nothing is deleted.

## Agency management
