## Profile-level permissions

Beyond workspace roles, control access to specific social profiles:

| Permission | Capabilities |
|------------|--------------|
| **Full Access** | Create, edit, publish, delete |
| **Can Edit** | Create and edit, cannot publish |
| **Can View** | View only, no modifications |
| **No Access** | Profile hidden from this user |

<Note>
Profile permissions are useful when different team members manage different clients, or when certain profiles (executive accounts) need tighter control.
</Note>

Set profile permissions in **Settings → Profiles** by clicking on a profile and managing access.

## Owner and ownership transfer

The Owner:
- Cannot be removed without transferring ownership
- Has access to billing and subscription
- Can delete the entire workspace

    The current Owner goes to **Settings → General**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Ownership section">
    Locate the ownership transfer option.

  <Step title="Select new Owner">
    Choose from existing Admins.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    After transfer, the previous Owner becomes an Admin.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Principle of least privilege">
    Give team members only the access they need. Most people should be Members, not Admins. Upgrade when genuinely needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular audits">
    Review team access quarterly:
    - Remove people who no longer need access
    - Verify roles are still appropriate
    - Check for unused accounts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prompt offboarding">
    Remove access immediately when someone leaves the organization. Don't wait for "cleanup" later—this is a security risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Profile restrictions">
    For sensitive accounts (executives, high-profile brands), use profile-level permissions to limit who can publish.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team member can't access a profile">
    Check profile-level permissions. They may have workspace access but no access to that specific profile. Update in **Settings → Profiles**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invitation not received">
    - Check spam/junk folders
    - Verify the email address is correct
    - Resend from the Pending Invitations list
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't change Owner role">
    Owner transfer requires the current Owner to initiate. Contact them to transfer ownership.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
