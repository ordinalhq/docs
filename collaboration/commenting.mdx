Comments enable team collaboration directly on posts. Leave feedback, ask questions, and discuss content without leaving Ordinal. Comments create a conversation thread attached to each post, visible to everyone with access.

## Leaving comments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the post">
    Click any post to open the detail view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the comment area">
    Scroll to the comments section in the sidebar or below the preview.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your comment">
    Type your feedback in the comment field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send">
    Press **Enter** or click **Send**.
    
    <Check>
    Your comment appears immediately. The post author is notified.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## @Mentions

Tag specific people to notify them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Type @">
    In your comment, type `@` to trigger the mention picker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search">
    Start typing a name to filter results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select">
    Click or press Enter to insert the mention.
  </Step>
</Steps>

When you @mention someone:
- They receive a notification
- They're added as a subscriber to the post
- The mention is highlighted in the comment

**Example uses:**
- "@Sarah should this go out before the press release?"
- "@Legal please review the compliance language"
- "@Marketing-team this one's ready for your input"

<Tip>
Use @mentions to ensure the right people see your feedback. Don't assume they'll check on their own.
</Tip>

## Inline comments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select text">
    Highlight the specific text you want to comment on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click comment icon">
    A comment icon appears near your selection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write feedback">
    Your comment links directly to that text.
    
    <Check>
    Inline comments make it clear exactly what you're referencing—great for suggesting word changes.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Comment features

    Quick reactions let you acknowledge without adding to the thread:
    
    | Reaction | Meaning |

## Resolving comments

Mark comments as resolved when feedback has been addressed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Address the feedback">
    Make the requested changes to the post.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Resolve">
    Click the **Resolve** button on the comment.
    
    <Check>
    The comment collapses, reducing visual clutter. It remains accessible for reference.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Resolve comments as you address them. This creates a clear trail of what's been handled and what's still pending.
</Tip>

## Editing and deleting

### Edit your comments

Made a typo? Click the edit icon on your comment to revise it. Edited comments show an "edited" indicator.

### Delete comments

Remove comments you no longer need:
- Click delete and confirm
- Only comment authors and Admins can delete
- Deleted comments cannot be recovered

<Warning>
Consider resolving instead of deleting—you may need the context later.
</Warning>

## Comments vs activity

The post sidebar shows both:

| Type | What it contains |
|------|------------------|
| **Comments** | Manual feedback from team members—discussions, mentions, collaboration |
| **Activity** | Automatic system log—edits, status changes, publishing events |

Both provide context on a post's history but serve different purposes.

## Notifications

Stay updated on comment activity:

| Event | When you're notified |
|-------|---------------------|
| New comments | When someone comments on posts you're subscribed to |
| Replies | When someone replies to your comment |
| Mentions | When you're @mentioned anywhere |

Configure which notifications you receive in **Settings → Notifications**.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific">
    Reference exactly what you're commenting about. "The second paragraph needs work" beats "This needs work."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use @mentions">
    Ensure the right people see your feedback. Tag them directly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep it constructive">
    Focus on improvements and suggestions rather than just criticism.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Close the loop">
    Resolve comments when addressed. Mark things done.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check regularly">
    Don't miss feedback. Review posts with pending comments before scheduling.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Comment not saving">
    Check your internet connection. Comments require an active connection. Try refreshing and resubmitting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't mention a team member">
    - Verify they're a member of your workspace
    - Type more characters to filter results
    - Only active workspace members can be mentioned
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not receiving notifications">
    - Check notification settings for the affected user
    - Verify email isn't in spam
    - Check in-app notification preferences
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
