Comments let your team collaborate directly on posts—leave feedback, ask questions, and refine content before it goes live. Ordinal supports two types of comments: inline comments for specific text suggestions, and post comments for overall feedback.

## Inline comments

Inline comments attach directly to specific text in your post—perfect for suggesting word changes, asking about a particular phrase, or pointing out issues.

**To add an inline comment:**

1. Select the text you want to comment on
2. Click the **Comment** button that appears
3. Write your feedback and submit

The selected text is highlighted, and your comment links directly to it.

### Replies and reactions

Inline comments support threaded conversations:

- **Reply** to continue the discussion
- **React with emoji** to acknowledge without adding to the thread
- **@Mention** teammates to loop them in

### Resolving comments

When feedback has been addressed, click **Resolve** on the comment. Resolved comments collapse to reduce visual clutter but remain accessible for reference.

<Tip>
  Resolve comments as you address them. This creates a clear trail of what's been handled and what's still pending.
</Tip>

### Comments sidebar

Click the **Comments** button in the post header to open the comments sidebar. This gives you a centralized view of all inline comments across the post.

| View         | What it shows                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active**   | Comments that still need attention                        |
| **Resolved** | Toggle "Show resolved comments" to see addressed feedback |

Each comment shows the original highlighted text, making it easy to understand context even if the content has changed.

## Post comments

Post comments appear in the sidebar and are visible to everyone with access. Use them for general feedback, questions, or discussions about the post as a whole.

**To leave a comment:**

1. Open a post and find the **Comments** section in the sidebar
2. Type your message
3. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to send

Your comment appears immediately and the post author is notified.

### @Mentions

Tag teammates by typing `@` followed by their name. When you @mention someone:

- They receive a notification (in-app, email, or Slack based on their preferences)
- They're added as a subscriber to the post
- The mention appears highlighted in your comment

<Tip>
  Use @mentions to ensure the right people see your feedback—don't assume they'll check on their own.
</Tip>

### Deleting comments

Click the delete icon on your comment to remove it. Only comment authors and admins can delete comments. Deleted comments cannot be recovered.

<Note>
  Commenting on a post automatically subscribes you to it. You'll receive notifications when others comment or the post status changes.
</Note>
