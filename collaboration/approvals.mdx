Approvals ensure content gets reviewed before it goes live. Whether you're an agency managing client accounts, a team posting on behalf of executives, or an organization with compliance requirements—approvals add a review gate that protects your brand and keeps stakeholders informed.

Common use cases:

- **Agencies** - Get client sign-off before publishing to their accounts
- **Executive content** - Ensure leadership reviews posts on their personal brands
- **Brand consistency** - Maintain voice and messaging standards across teams
- **Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements with documented approval trails

## How it works

1. **Request** — Author finishes a post and requests approval from one or more reviewers
2. **Notify** — Reviewers receive notifications via Slack, email, or in-app (based on their preferences)
3. **Review** — Reviewers open the post, examine content, and approve or leave feedback

## Requesting approval

From any post or campaign, find the **Approvals** section in the sidebar and click **Request Approval**:

1. **Select reviewers** — Search and add one or more team members
2. **Set due date** (optional) — Reviewers get reminders when the due date arrives
3. **Choose blocking** — Toggle on if the post shouldn't publish without approval
4. **Add a note** — Give context: "Please check hashtags" or "Client needs to approve messaging"

The post shows "Pending" until reviewers respond.

<Tip>
  Add multiple approvers when you need sign-off from different stakeholders—marketing, legal, and the client can all review the same post.
</Tip>

## Blocking vs non-blocking

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Blocking">
    The post **cannot** be scheduled until approved.

    - Schedule button is disabled
    - Protects sensitive accounts from accidental publishing
    - Default for approval rules

    **Use for:** Client accounts, executive profiles, regulated content
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Non-Blocking (Default)">
    The post **can** be scheduled while approval is pending.

    - Approval is for visibility and awareness
    - Creates an audit trail
    - Post publishes regardless of approval status

    **Use for:** Informing stakeholders, low-risk content, FYI requests
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  **Enterprise feature:** On Enterprise plans, you can configure certain profiles to always have blocking approvals set. This ensures that certain accounts never publish without review - even if someone forgets to request approval manually.
</Note>

## Approvals Inbox

The **Approvals** page in the sidebar gives you a centralized view of posts still awaiting your approval, as well as outstanding approvals you've requested. You can filter the inbox by date range as well to focus on what's urgent.

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Awaiting your approval**     | Posts and campaigns where someone requested your review |
| **Approvals you've requested** | Posts where you're waiting on others                    |

    Yes. The mobile app supports reviewing and approving posts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are approval rules?">
