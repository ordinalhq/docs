## Overview

Approval workflows ensure content is reviewed before publishing. Set up multi-level approvals to maintain quality and brand consistency.

## How Approvals Work

1. **Author creates post** - Draft is submitted for review
2. **Reviewer notified** - Approvers receive notification
3. **Review and feedback** - Approve, reject, or request changes
4. **Post approved** - Ready to schedule or publish

## Setting Up Approval Workflows

### Basic Approval

Simple one-level approval:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Approvals**
2. Enable approvals for your workspace
3. Select default approvers
4. Save settings

### Multi-Level Approval

Create tiered approval processes:

1. **Level 1** - Team lead review
2. **Level 2** - Manager approval
3. **Level 3** - Legal/compliance (if needed)

### Profile-Specific Approvals

Set different approvers for different profiles:
- Executive accounts may need additional review
- Regional accounts may have local approvers
- Client accounts may require client approval

## Approval Actions

### Approve

Approve the post as-is:
- Post moves to "Approved" status
- Author is notified

### Request Changes

Ask for revisions:
- Add comments explaining needed changes
- Author is notified
- Post returns to draft

### Reject

Decline the post:

## Notifications

Configure how approvers are notified:
- **Email** - Immediate or digest
- **Slack** - Direct message or channel
- **In-app** - Dashboard notifications
- **Mobile** - Push notifications
