Approvals add a review gate before content can be published. Require sign-off from managers, clients, or stakeholders to maintain quality and brand consistency across your social presence.

## Why use approvals

| Use case | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **Quality control** | Catch errors before they go live |
| **Brand consistency** | Maintain voice and messaging standards |
| **Stakeholder alignment** | Get sign-off from decision makers |
| **Compliance** | Meet regulatory requirements |

Approvals are optional—enable them when you need review gates.

## How approvals work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Author creates post">
    A team member drafts content and submits for review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request approval">
    Author selects reviewers and sends the approval request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reviewer is notified">
    Approvers receive notifications via their preferred channels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and respond">
    Reviewer examines content and chooses:
    - **Approve** — Post is cleared for scheduling
    - **Reject** — Post needs changes
    - **Request changes** — Specific edits needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post proceeds">
    Approved posts can be scheduled. Rejected posts return to draft.
    
    <Check>
    Approved posts show a green badge and the Schedule button becomes active.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Requesting approval

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the post">
    Navigate to the post you want approved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Approvals">
    Locate the **Approvals** section in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Request Approval">
    Click **Request Approval** to open the dialog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select reviewers">
    Search and select one or more approvers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add notes (optional)">
    Include context for the reviewer:
    - "Please check hashtags and CTA"
    - "Client needs to approve messaging"
    - "Legal review required"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send">
    Click to send the request. The post shows "Pending Approval" status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Add context in your approval request. Reviewers can respond faster when they know what to focus on.
</Tip>

## Reviewing and responding

When you receive an approval request:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the post">
    Click the notification or find the post in your approval queue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review content">
    Examine text, media, settings, and scheduled accounts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond">
    Choose your response:
    
    | Action | Result |
    |--------|--------|
    | **Approve** | Post cleared for scheduling |
    | **Reject** | Post needs changes, cannot schedule |
    | **Request changes** | Specific edits needed |
    
    Add feedback explaining your decision.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Approval types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Blocking">
    Posts **cannot** be scheduled until approved.
    
    - Schedule button is disabled
    - Must get approval first
    - Default for required approvals
    
    **Use when:**
    - Client content that must be approved
    - Regulated industries requiring sign-off
    - High-stakes accounts where errors are costly
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Non-blocking">
    Posts **can** be scheduled while approval is pending.
    
    - Approval is for visibility
    - Creates an audit trail
    - Post publishes regardless
    
    **Use when:**
    - Informing stakeholders of content
    - Creating records without slowing publishing
    - Low-risk content needing awareness
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuring approval workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable approvals">
    Go to **Settings → Approvals** and toggle **Require approval before publishing**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select default approvers">
    Choose team members who can approve content by default.
    
    <Tip>
    Select multiple approvers so reviews don't bottleneck on one person.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure per-profile (optional)">
    Set different approval requirements for different profiles:
    - Executive accounts may need additional review
    - Client accounts may need client sign-off
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    All new posts now require approval before scheduling.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multiple approvers

Request approval from multiple people when you need sign-off from different stakeholders:

- Marketing manager for messaging
- Legal for compliance
- Client for final approval

Configure whether you need approval from **one person** or **all people** before the post is cleared.

## Approval statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Not requested** | No approval needed or requested |
| **Pending** | Awaiting reviewer response |
| **Approved** | Reviewer granted approval |
| **Rejected** | Reviewer declined |
| **Changes requested** | Specific edits needed |

## Bypassing approval

<Warning>
Admins can bypass approval requirements for urgent situations. Use sparingly—too many bypasses undermine the workflow.
</Warning>

To bypass:
1. Open the post
2. Click **Bypass Approval** (Admin only)
3. Confirm and add a reason

Bypasses are logged for audit purposes.

## Troubleshooting
