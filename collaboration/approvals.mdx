## Overview

Approval workflows ensure content is reviewed before publishing. Set up multi-level approvals to maintain quality and brand consistency.

## How Approvals Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Author Creates Post">
    A team member drafts content and submits it for review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reviewer Gets Notified">
    Designated approvers receive a notification to review the post.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Feedback">
    Reviewers can approve, reject, or request changes with comments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post Approved">
    Once approved, the post is ready to schedule or publish.
    
    <Check>
    Approved posts show a green "Approved" badge and can be scheduled.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Approval Workflows

### Basic Approval

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Go to **Settings** → **Approvals** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Approvals">
    Toggle on "Require approval before publishing."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Default Approvers">
    Choose team members who can approve content.
    
    <Tip>
    Select multiple approvers so reviews don't bottleneck on one person.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Settings">
    Click **Save** to enable the approval workflow.
    
    <Check>
    All new posts now require approval before they can be published.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Multi-Level Approval

Create tiered approval processes for sensitive content:

1. **Level 1** - Team lead review
2. **Level 2** - Manager approval
3. **Level 3** - Legal/compliance (if needed)

<Tip>
Multi-level approvals are ideal for executive accounts or regulated industries where content must pass multiple checkpoints.
</Tip>

### Profile-Specific Approvals

Set different approvers for different profiles:
- Executive accounts may need additional review
- Regional accounts may have local approvers
- Client accounts may require client approval

## Approval Actions

### Approve

Approve the post as-is:
- Post moves to "Approved" status
- Author is notified
- Post can be scheduled

### Request Changes

Ask for revisions:
- Add comments explaining needed changes
- Author is notified
- Post returns to draft status

### Reject

Decline the post:
- Add reason for rejection
- Author is notified
- Post is not published

<Warning>
Rejected posts remain accessible for reference but cannot be published without resubmission.
</Warning>

## Notifications

Configure how approvers are notified:
- **Email** - Immediate or digest
- **Slack** - Direct message or channel
- **In-app** - Dashboard notifications
- **Mobile** - Push notifications

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Approver not receiving notifications">
    Check the approver's notification settings. Ensure they have the correct channels enabled in Settings → Notifications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Post stuck in pending review">
    Contact the designated approver directly. You can also reassign to a different approver from the post detail view.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Need to bypass approval">
    Workspace admins can bypass approval requirements for urgent posts. Use sparingly to maintain workflow integrity.
