## Profile-Level Permissions

Control access to specific social profiles:

|------------|-------------|
| **Full Access** | Create, edit, publish, delete |
| **Can Edit** | Create and edit, cannot publish |
| **Can View** | View only, no editing |
| **No Access** | Profile hidden from user |

<Tip>
Use profile-level permissions when team members should only manage specific clients or brands.
</Tip>

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Least privilege principle">
    Give team members only the access they need for their role. Start with lower permissions and upgrade as needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular audits">
    Review team access quarterly and remove unused accounts. Check for team members who no longer need access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Offboarding">
    Remove access immediately when team members leave the organization. Don't wait for "cleanup" later.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team member can't access a profile">
    Check profile-level permissions. The user may have workspace access but no access to that specific profile.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invitation not received">
    Check spam folders. You can resend the invitation from the Pending Invitations list.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't change Owner role">
    Owner transfer requires the current owner to initiate. Contact the workspace owner to transfer ownership.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
